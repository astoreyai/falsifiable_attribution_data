# Quick Todo Reference Card
**Defense Readiness:** 95/100 Infrastructure (83/100 Actual) → Target: 96-98/100
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

---

## 🔥 THIS WEEK (Week 1) - DO IMMEDIATELY

### Day 1: Git Commit (30-60 min) ← HIGHEST PRIORITY ⚠️
```bash
cd /home/aaron/projects/xai
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Multi-dataset infrastructure and defense preparation (Phase 1 Complete 91%)"
git push
```
**WHY:** Backs up 31 hours of work, prevents catastrophic loss

---

### Day 1-2: Download CelebA (30-60 min)
```bash
python data/download_celeba.py
```
**WHY:** Unblocks multi-dataset validation (+11-14 defense points)

---

### Day 3-7: Run Multi-Dataset Experiments (8-10 hours GPU)
```bash
python experiments/run_multidataset_experiment_6_1.py --datasets lfw,celeba --n-pairs 500
```
**WHY:** Addresses committee's #1 concern: "Does this generalize?"
**IMPACT:** Defense readiness 83/100 → 91-94/100

## 📞 HELP & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If CelebA Download Fails
1. Try manual download from Google Drive
2. Use Kaggle API: `kaggle datasets download -d jessicali9530/celeba-dataset`
3. Fallback: VGGFace2 (9,131 identities, no registration)

### If GPU Unavailable
1. Check `nvidia-smi` for status
2. AWS EC2 p3.2xlarge: `aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxx --instance-type p3.2xlarge`
3. Google Colab Pro+: https://colab.research.google.com/

### If Experiments Crash
1. Check CUDA version: `nvcc --version` (should be 11.8)
2. Reduce batch size in run_multidataset_experiment_6_1.py
3. Check disk space: `df -h` (need ~500 MB for results)

### If Committee Can't Schedule
1. Provide 3-4 additional date options
2. Extend timeline by 2-4 weeks (buffer available)
3. Consider virtual defense (Zoom) if conflicts persist
