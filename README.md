## Who Should Use This

### ‚úÖ Perfect For:
- Solo PhD students working independently
- Computational/theoretical research
- Using public datasets (no IRB required)
- Self-motivated, systematic researchers

### ‚ùå Not Ideal For:
- Human subjects research requiring IRB approval
- Research requiring industry partnerships
- Multi-author collaborative dissertations
- Non-computational research requiring lab equipment

---

## Philosophy

This pipeline was built with these principles:

1. **Honest Claims Only** - Never claim what you can't prove
2. **Systematic Execution** - Complete phases in order
3. **Template-Based** - Don't start from scratch
4. **Quality Focus** - Every claim needs evidence
5. **Realistic Timelines** - 6-15 months for completion

---

## Requirements

### Software
- **Python 3.8+** (if using code generation/analysis)
- **LaTeX** (for PDF compilation)
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full  # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
- **Git** (for version control)

### Hardware
- Any modern laptop/desktop
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, SSD storage
- Optional: GPU (for computational research)

### Time Commitment
- **Minimal:** 6-8 weeks (using existing research)
- **Typical:** 6-9 months (moderate research)
- **Comprehensive:** 12-15 months (full research execution)
