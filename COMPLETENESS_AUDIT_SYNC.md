## COORDINATION PROTOCOL

1. **All agents start simultaneously** (parallel execution)
2. **Agents read this document** for shared context
3. **Agents write findings** to their respective sections
4. **Agents identify cross-dependencies** and note them
5. **Final synthesis** combines all agent outputs

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### Completeness
- [ ] Are all 5 experiments (6.1-6.5) run with final parameters?
- [ ] Does each theorem have experimental validation?
- [ ] Are all fixes (P0 + P1) tested?

### Data & Reproducibility
- [ ] Is all data saved in structured format?
- [ ] Can experiments be rerun with same results?
- [ ] Are random seeds, parameters documented?
- [ ] Is data backed up (3-2-1 rule)?

### Documentation
- [ ] Are all tables updated with real results?
- [ ] Are all figures generated and saved?
- [ ] Is LaTeX compiled successfully?
- [ ] Are all sections reviewed and updated?

### Robustness
- [ ] Is single-dataset validation sufficient?
- [ ] Should we add CelebA, VGGFace2, or other datasets?
- [ ] What's the risk/benefit tradeoff?
