## Falsifiable Attribution Methods PhD Dissertation

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Analysis Type:** Critical Re-evaluation
**User Request:** "There is no perfect success. Analyze Experiment 6.1 again and results."

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: What We Actually Found

**Your suspicion was CORRECT.** While the dissertation doesn't claim "100% perfect success" (it honestly disclaims synthetic data), the **actual experimental execution has major gaps**:

### The Reality:

1. **NO perfect success rates** - Real data shows 46-52% falsification rates with NO significant differences between methods (p=1.0)
2. **Sample size shortfall** - Ran n=200 instead of planned n=1,000 (underpowered: requires n=221)
3. **Production run failures** - The n=500 experiment ran but saved EMPTY results files
4. **Theory-experiment mismatches** - Experiment 6.2 claims to test "Theorem 3.6" but actually tests something completely different
5. **Missing experiments** - Theorem 3.5b promised validation never conducted

### The Good News:

- ✅ Dissertation is **scientifically honest** (explicitly disclaims synthetic data)
- ✅ Algorithm convergence works (97.4% success rate - a real achievement!)
- ✅ Core theorem (3.5 Falsifiability Criterion) is conceptually sound
- ✅ One experiment (6.4) achieved adequate sample size (n=500)

## PART I: THE FIVE THEOREMS EXPLAINED

### THEOREM 3.5: Falsifiability Criterion

**Plain English:**
An explanation is "falsifiable" (scientifically testable) if it makes clear predictions: "Feature A matters, Feature B doesn't matter." We can test this by masking those features and measuring the model's response. If important features cause large changes and unimportant features cause small changes, the explanation passes the test.

**Three Conditions (must ALL hold):**
1. **Non-triviality:** Identifies BOTH important AND unimportant features (not "everything matters equally")
2. **Differential prediction:** Important features cause LARGE embedding shifts (>τ_high), unimportant cause SMALL shifts (<τ_low)
3. **Separation margin:** Clear gap between "large" and "small" (τ_high - τ_low ≥ ε)

**Why It Matters:**
- First rigorous criterion for XAI trustworthiness
- Extends Popper's philosophy of science to machine learning
- Enables forensic deployment (Daubert legal standard compliance)

**Example:**
- Grad-CAM says "eyes important (0.85), background unimportant (0.08)"
- Mask eyes → 0.82 radians shift (large ✓)
- Mask background → 0.31 radians shift (small ✓)
- Gap: 0.82 - 0.31 = 0.51 > 0 (clear separation ✓)
- **Verdict:** Explanation passes (NOT falsified)

---

### THEOREM 3.6: Counterfactual Existence on Hyperspheres

**Plain English:**
You can ALWAYS find a modified image that shifts the embedding by any desired amount (e.g., "move 45° on the hypersphere"), as long as you're willing to change the right features. This guarantees falsification tests are possible - counterfactuals always exist.

**Mathematical Basis:**
Uses Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT): If you smoothly modify an image from "no mask" (distance=0) to "full mask" (distance=d_max), you MUST cross every intermediate distance. So target distance δ_target is guaranteed to be reachable.

**Why It Matters:**
- **Without this theorem, falsification testing would be impossible** (can't test if counterfactuals don't exist)
- Proof is constructive → leads to Algorithm 3.1 for generating counterfactuals
- Works for any continuous model (not just ArcFace)

**Example:**
- Want to shift embedding by 0.8 radians (target)
- Original image: distance = 0 (no modification)
- Fully masked image: distance = 1.2 radians (measured)
- Since 0 < 0.8 < 1.2 and model is continuous, IVT guarantees some partial mask (α=0.67) achieves exactly 0.8 radians

---

### THEOREM 3.7: Computational Complexity

**Plain English:**
Falsification testing costs: **Time ≈ K × T × D × |M|**

- K = number of counterfactual samples (e.g., 200)
- T = optimization steps per counterfactual (e.g., 100)
- D = model forward pass time (e.g., 10 milliseconds)
- |M| = number of feature groups tested (e.g., 10)

For typical settings: 200 × 100 × 0.01s × 10 = **2,000 seconds ≈ 33 minutes** (with parallelization: ~3-5 minutes)

**Why It Matters:**
- Lets you predict if falsification is computationally feasible BEFORE running experiments
- Identifies bottleneck: model forward passes (D) - optimize this first
- Trade-off: 2-10× slower than SHAP/LIME, but provides scientific rigor

**Example:**
Testing 1,000 face pairs:
- Predicted: 200 × 100 × 0.008s × 2 × 1,000 = 320,000s = 89 hours
- With GPU batching (10×) + optimizations (13×): 89 / 130 ≈ **41 minutes** (practical!)

---

### THEOREM 3.8: Approximation Bound (Hoeffding)

**Plain English:**
To estimate the average embedding shift accurately, you need **K ≥ 183 samples** (for ε=0.1 radians precision, 95% confidence). In practice, use **K=200** for safety.

**Statistical Guarantee:**
With K=200 samples, you can say: "I'm 95% confident the true average is within ±0.1 radians of my measured average."

**Why It Matters:**
- Tells you HOW MANY counterfactuals to generate (not too few → unreliable, not too many → wasted computation)
- Provides formal confidence intervals for court evidence
- Based on standard Hoeffding inequality (well-established statistics)

**Example:**
- Generate 200 counterfactuals, measure average shift: 0.79 radians
- Theorem 3.8 says: True average is in [0.69, 0.89] radians with 95% confidence
- Threshold: τ_high = 0.75 radians
- Since 0.79 > 0.75 and even lower bound (0.69) is close, **conclude: high-attribution features cause large shifts ✓**

---

### THEOREM 3.5b: Biometric Falsifiability Criterion (ADDITIONAL)

**Plain English:**
For face recognition specifically, an attribution is falsified if:
1. Changing "unimportant" features breaks face verification (should preserve identity >95%)
2. "Important" vs "unimportant" features produce identical error rates (FAR/FRR curves overlap)

**Why It Matters:**
- Adapts general falsifiability (Theorem 3.5) to biometric constraints
- Adds identity preservation requirement (critical for face recognition)
- Provides stricter test than general criterion

**Status:** ❌ **NOT EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED** (theory promises validation, results don't deliver)

---

## PART II: THEORY-EXPERIMENT MAPPING (HONEST ASSESSMENT)

### Theorem 3.5: Falsifiability Criterion

**What Experiment Tests This?**
- **Experiment 6.1** (Falsification Rate Comparison)

**What The Dissertation Claims:**
- Sample size: n=1,000 pairs
- Geodesic IG: 100% success
- SHAP/LIME: 0% success
- Statistical significance: p < 10^-180

**What The ACTUAL DATA Shows:**
- **Real sample size: n=200** (NOT 1,000)
- **Real results** (from `/experiments/results_real/exp_6_1/exp_6_1_results_20251018_180300.json`):
  - Grad-CAM: **46.1% FR** (95% CI: [39.3%, 53.0%])
  - SHAP: **46.8% FR** (95% CI: [40.0%, 53.7%])
  - LIME: **51.8% FR** (95% CI: [44.9%, 58.6%])
  - **Chi-square: p = 1.000** (NO significant difference!)
- **Sample size validation: FAILED** (`"is_valid": false` - requires n=221, only had n=200)

**Discrepancy Explanation:**
The dissertation HONESTLY DISCLAIMS this in Chapter 6:
> "**IMPORTANT:** This chapter currently uses **SYNTHETIC DATA**... What CANNOT be claimed: ❌ Specific falsification rate percentages"

**But the problem is:**
1. ✅ Dissertation is honest about using synthetic data
2. ❌ BUT real data WAS collected (n=200)
3. ❌ Real data shows OPPOSITE findings (no significant differences)
4. ❌ Real data was NOT integrated into the dissertation

**Production Run (n=500) Failure:**
```bash
$ ls production_facenet_n500/exp6_1_n500_20251018_214202/visualizations/ | wc -l
500  # ✅ Visualizations created

$ cat production_facenet_n500/exp6_1_n500_20251018_214202/results.json
{
  "methods": {},          # ❌ EMPTY!
  "statistical_tests": {} # ❌ EMPTY!
}
```

The experiment RAN (500 saliency maps saved) but FAILED to save results - likely exception during falsification testing caught but not logged.

**HONEST VERDICT:**
- ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VALIDATED - WITH MAJOR GAPS**
- Theorem 3.5 is conceptually sound and well-defined
- Small-scale test (n=200) shows NO significant method differences (contradicts synthetic results)
- Production-scale test (n=500) FAILED completely
- **Claim of "100% vs 0%"**: Only in synthetic data, NOT validated with real data

**What This Means:**
The falsifiability criterion is a **good theoretical contribution**, but empirical validation is **incomplete**. With current data (n=200, underpowered):
- Cannot claim methods are significantly different
- Cannot answer research questions RQ1-RQ4
- Need to either: (1) re-run at n=500-1,000 OR (2) honestly report "pilot study, no significant findings"

---

### Theorem 3.6: Counterfactual Existence

**What Experiment Tests This?**
- Discussion mentions: "96.4% convergence rate"
- Experiment 6.2 claims to test "Theorem 3.6" ❌ **BUT THIS IS WRONG**

**What Theorem 3.6 Actually Says:**
- Counterfactuals exist on hyperspheres (uses Intermediate Value Theorem proof)
- For any target distance δ_target, you can find image modification achieving it
- Includes "Assumption 1: Achievable target" and "Assumption 2: Plausible counterfactuals"

**What Experiment 6.2 Actually Tests:**
- **Margin vs. reliability correlation**
- Finding: Spearman ρ = 1.0 (perfect correlation)
- High margin (≥0.20) → 100% success
- Low margin (<0.10) → 75% success

**The Problem:**
- Experiment 6.2 does NOT test counterfactual existence
- Experiment 6.2 does NOT validate Theorem 3.6's predictions
- **Theorem 3.6 says NOTHING about margin-reliability correlation**

**Where Is Theorem 3.6 Actually Validated?**
- Discussion Chapter 8: "Algorithm~3.1 converged in 96.4% of cases"
- No dedicated experimental section
- No tables, figures, or detailed results
- Sample size unclear

**HONEST VERDICT:**
- ❌ **CITATION ERROR - WRONG THEOREM TESTED**
- The ACTUAL Theorem 3.6 (counterfactual existence) is only weakly validated (96.4% mentioned in passing)
- Experiment 6.2 tests something different (possibly belongs to a missing theorem/corollary about margin effects)
- **Empirical validation of Theorem 3.6: WEAK** (96.4% convergence mentioned but not properly documented)

**What This Means:**
There's confusion in the dissertation about what Theorem 3.6 predicts. Either:
1. Experiment 6.2 should cite a DIFFERENT theorem (margin-reliability theorem not numbered)
2. OR there's a missing corollary linking margin to reliability
3. OR earlier draft had different theorem numbering

Regardless, the **actual** Theorem 3.6 (counterfactual existence via IVT) lacks strong experimental documentation.

---

### Theorem 3.5b: Biometric Falsifiability

**What Experiment Tests This?**
- ❌ **NONE**

**What The Theory Promises:**
Theory Chapter 3, Section 3.5:
> "Chapter 6 implements both falsification tests...measuring:
> - Identity preservation rates for low-attribution features (expected: >95%)
> - FAR@FRR=1% for high vs. low attribution features (expected separation: >0.05)"

**What The Results Deliver:**
- ❌ Results Chapter 7 never mentions Theorem 3.5b
- ❌ No experiment tests "low-attribution feature identity preservation"
- ❌ No FAR/FRR curves comparing high vs. low attribution features
- Experiment 6.6 tests "identity preservation" (90% overall) but NOT specifically for low-attribution features

**HONEST VERDICT:**
- ❌ **NOT VALIDATED**
- Theory makes specific promises ("Chapter 6 implements...")
- Results do NOT deliver those tests
- Possible confusion: "Chapter 6" in theory refers to Implementation chapter, not Results chapter?

**What This Means:**
Theorem 3.5b's biometric-specific falsification tests were **never conducted**. Either:
1. Remove the promise from Chapter 3
2. OR add the missing experiments

---

### Theorem 3.7: Computational Complexity

**What Experiment Tests This?**
- ❌ No direct scaling experiment
- Only timing reports in various sections

**What The Theory Predicts:**
- Complexity: O(K·T·D·|M|)
- For K=100, T=100, D=10ms, |M|=10 → **~100 seconds** per image

**What The Results Report:**
- Discussion Ch 8: "Runtime averaged **24 seconds**"
- Experiment 6.6: Geodesic IG takes **0.82 seconds**
- Theory Ch 3: Predicts **~100 seconds**

**Contradiction Analysis:**
These measure DIFFERENT things:
1. **Attribution generation:** 0.82s (just the saliency map, no falsification)
2. **Single falsification test:** 24s (one feature set with K counterfactuals)
3. **Full validation:** 100s (all |M| feature sets tested)

**Problem:** Unclear which is correct, and no experiment validates O(K·T·D·|M|) scaling relationship

**HONEST VERDICT:**
- ⚠️ **POORLY VALIDATED**
- Timing numbers reported but don't clearly match theoretical prediction
- No experiment testing complexity scaling (vary K, T, |M| and measure runtime)
- Conflicting numbers across chapters

**What This Means:**
Theorem 3.7 makes a specific complexity claim (O(K·T·D·|M|)), but experiments don't test the scaling relationship. To validate:
- Run experiments with K ∈ {50, 100, 200} and measure runtime (should scale linearly)
- Similarly for T, |M|
- Show runtime plots confirming O(·) relationship

---

### Theorem 3.8: Approximation Bound

**What Experiment Tests This?**
- Experiment 6.5 (Sample Size Analysis)

**What The Theory Predicts:**
- Formula: K ≥ (π²/2ε²) ln(2/δ)
- For ε=0.1, δ=0.05 → **K ≥ 183**, recommend **K=200**

**What The Results Find:**
- Experiment 6.5 tests n ∈ {50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}
- Variance reduction: σ² ∝ 1/n ✓ (matches Hoeffding prediction)
- n=200 achieves 95% confidence interval coverage ✓
- Actual variance ratios match predicted (within 5%) ✓

**HONEST VERDICT:**
- ✅ **WEAKLY VALIDATED**
- Experiment 6.5 provides indirect support (variance scales correctly)
- But the specific formula K ≥ (π²/2ε²)ln(2/δ) is NOT directly tested
- Independence assumption questionable (face pixels are correlated)

**What This Means:**
Theorem 3.8 is theoretically sound (follows from standard Hoeffding inequality). Experiment 6.5 shows the expected variance pattern. But:
- Formula not explicitly tested (should calculate K from formula, verify it achieves ε error)
- Independence assumption for face features not validated (pixels spatially correlated)

---

## PART III: WHAT THE RESULTS ACTUALLY MEAN

### Finding 1: No "Perfect Success" in Real Data

**Claimed (Synthetic):**
- Geodesic IG: 100% success
- SHAP/LIME: 0% success

**Actual (Real n=200):**
- Grad-CAM: 46.1% falsification rate
- SHAP: 46.8% falsification rate
- LIME: 51.8% falsification rate
- **p-value: 1.000** (no significant difference)

**What This Means:**
With real data (LFW faces, FaceNet model, n=200):
- ALL methods have moderate falsification rates (46-52%)
- NO method is significantly better than others
- The "100% vs 0%" gap from synthetic data does NOT appear in real data

**Implications:**
1. ❌ Cannot claim Geodesic IG is superior based on current real data
2. ❌ Cannot claim SHAP/LIME fail completely
3. ⚠️ Study is underpowered (n=200 < required n=221)
4. ⚠️ Need n=500-1,000 to detect differences (if they exist)

**Honest interpretation:**
Either:
- (A) Methods are truly similar in performance (null hypothesis)
- (B) Sample size too small to detect real differences (underpowered study)
- (C) Real data is harder than synthetic (all methods struggle)

---

### Finding 2: Margin-Reliability Correlation is Real

**From Experiment 6.2 (n=200 real data):**
- Spearman ρ = **1.0** (perfect rank correlation)
- p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- High margin (≥0.20): 100% success
- Low margin (<0.10): 75% success

**What This Means:**
- ✅ This finding IS validated with real data
- ✅ Strong evidence that margin predicts reliability
- ✅ Enables evidence-based deployment thresholds

**Practical guideline:**
- Forensic applications: Only use explanations when margin ≥ 0.20 (100% reliable)
- Commercial applications: Flag for review when margin < 0.10 (75% reliable)

**But:** This validates a DIFFERENT theorem than claimed (not Theorem 3.6)

---

### Finding 3: Algorithm Converges Successfully

**From Discussion mentions:**
- 97.4% convergence rate (487/500)
- Mean iterations: 64 ± 23
- Max iterations: 100

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Algorithm 3.1 (counterfactual generation) WORKS
- ✅ Theorem 3.6's constructive proof leads to practical algorithm
- ✅ This is a REAL success - demonstrates technical feasibility

**Implication:**
Even though full experiments failed (n=500 empty results), the core algorithmic contribution is validated.

---

### Finding 4: Sample Size Matters

**From Experiment 6.5:**
- n=50: Large error (σ=6.9%)
- n=200: Moderate error (σ=3.5%)
- n=500: Small error (σ=2.2%)
- n=1000: Very small error (σ=1.5%)

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Confirms Hoeffding bound predictions (σ² ∝ 1/n)
- ⚠️ Reveals why n=200 was insufficient (should use n≥500)
- ✅ Provides practical guidance for future work

**Current study implications:**
- Experiments 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 (n=200): Underpowered, cannot detect moderate effects
- Experiment 6.4 (n=500): Adequate power ✓
- Experiment 6.5: Tests sample size effects ✓

---

### Finding 5: Production Run Failures Indicate Technical Debt

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "experiment": "Experiment 6.1 - FINAL REAL Implementation",
  "parameters": { "n_pairs": 500 },
  "methods": {},          // EMPTY
  "statistical_tests": {} // EMPTY
}
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Experiment script runs (500 visualizations saved)
- ❌ Falsification testing code fails silently
- ❌ Results aggregation never completes
- ❌ No error logging captured

**Root cause hypothesis:**
Line 382-407 in `run_final_experiment_6_1.py`:
```python
falsification_result = falsification_test(...)
results[method_name]['falsification_tests'].append(falsification_result)
```
Likely `falsification_test()` throws exception, caught by outer try-except, logged but execution continues, leaving `falsification_tests` empty.

**Implication:**
- Need to debug and fix the falsification testing code
- Re-run n=500 experiment with proper error handling
- This is FIXABLE technical debt, not fundamental flaw

---

## PART V: PATH FORWARD - FIXING THE GAPS

### Option A: Complete the Work (Recommended for PhD Defense)

**Required actions:**
1. **Debug n=500 production run** (highest priority)
   - Fix `falsification_test()` silent failures
   - Add proper error logging
   - Re-run Experiment 6.1 at n=500

2. **Integrate real data**
   - Replace synthetic results in Chapter 6 with real n=200 findings
   - Honestly report "no significant differences at n=200"
   - Discuss as limitation

3. **Fix Theorem 3.6 citations**
   - Remove wrong citations in Experiment 6.2
   - Add proper validation of counterfactual existence (document 96.4% convergence)
   - Possibly add missing theorem for margin-reliability

4. **Add missing experiments** OR **remove promises**
   - Either conduct Theorem 3.5b tests (identity preservation, FAR/FRR)
   - OR revise Chapter 3 to remove the promise

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks of focused work

**Result:** Defensible dissertation with honest results

---

### Option B: Pivot to Implementation Contribution

**Reframe dissertation as:**
- "Framework for falsifiable attribution methods in biometric systems"
- Emphasis on theoretical contribution (5 theorems) + algorithm design
- Position n=200 results as "pilot study demonstrating feasibility"
- Acknowledge statistical power limitations

**Required revisions:**
1. Update title: "A Framework for..." or "Towards Falsifiable..."
2. Revise research questions to match what WAS achieved
3. Emphasize algorithm convergence (97.4%) as success metric
4. Frame synthetic results as "simulation study" not "validation"

**Timeline:** 1 week of writing revisions

**Result:** Honest contribution focusing on methods, not empirical validation

---

### Option C: Minimal Fixes for Graduation

**Bare minimum to defend:**
1. Fix Theorem 3.6 citation errors (find-replace in Chapter 7)
2. Add explicit disclaimer in Results: "n=200 pilot study, underpowered"
3. Acknowledge n=500 run failure as future work
4. Clarify which claims are synthetic vs real data

**Timeline:** 2-3 days

**Result:** Technically correct but with acknowledged limitations

---

## CONCLUSION: THE HONEST VERDICT

**User's suspicion: VALIDATED**

There is indeed **no perfect success**. The "100% vs 0%" results are synthetic data (honestly disclaimed), and real data shows:
- 46-52% falsification rates
- NO significant differences (p=1.0)
- Sample size too small (n=200 < required n=221)

**However:**
- ✅ Researcher was scientifically honest (explicit disclaimers)
- ✅ Strong theoretical contributions (formal theorems)
- ✅ Algorithm works (97.4% convergence)
- ❌ But experimental validation is incomplete
- ❌ Production run failed (n=500 empty results)
- ❌ Theory-experiment mismatches (Theorem 3.6 citation error)

**Bottom line:**
This is a **good theoretical dissertation** with **incomplete empirical validation**. The core ideas (falsifiability criterion, geodesic methods) are sound. The execution fell short of the ambitious experimental plan (n=1,000 studies), but enough was completed (n=200 pilots, one n=500 study) to demonstrate feasibility.

**For PhD defense:**
With 2-3 weeks of focused work to fix bugs and integrate real data, this becomes a **defensible contribution**. The key is honesty: acknowledge limitations, report actual findings, emphasize theoretical and algorithmic achievements.
