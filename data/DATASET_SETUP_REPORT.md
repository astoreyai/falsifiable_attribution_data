## Download Options Research

I investigated multiple download sources and selected Kaggle as the recommended option:

### Option 1: Kaggle (RECOMMENDED) ✓

**Why Recommended:**
- Smallest download: 2.12 GB (vs 40GB for full dataset)
- Fast and reliable
- No torrent client needed
- Test set only (no unnecessary training data)
- Simple API authentication

**Status:** Ready to use (needs credentials)

### Option 2: Academic Torrents (Alternative)

**Pros:**
- Complete dataset (40.25 GB with train + test)
- No account registration
- Academic-focused distribution

**Cons:**
- Requires torrent client installation
- Much larger download (includes training set)
- Slower download speeds

**Status:** Torrent file downloaded, ready if needed

### Option 3: Official Oxford VGG (Last Resort)

**Cons:**
- Requires manual registration
- Approval can take days
- Links may be unavailable

**Status:** Not pursued (better alternatives available)

## Integration with Dissertation

### Where This Dataset Will Be Used

1. **Chapter 4 (Methodology)**
   - Dataset description
   - Test set specifications
   - Sampling strategy
   - Ethical considerations

2. **Chapter 6 (Results)**
   - Model evaluation metrics
   - Performance on VGGFace2 test set
   - Comparison with baselines

3. **Chapter 7 (Analysis)**

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Kaggle credentials not working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# Check permissions
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# Test CLI
cd /home/aaron/projects/xai/PHD_PIPELINE/falsifiable_attribution_dissertation
./venv/bin/kaggle datasets list
```

### Issue: Download fails or times out

**Solutions:**
1. Retry the script (resume capability)
2. Manual download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/greatgamedota/vggface2-test
3. Try torrent option (see `DOWNLOAD_OPTIONS.md`)

### Issue: Verification fails (wrong image count)

**Solutions:**
1. Check if download completed fully
2. Re-extract: `unzip -o vggface2-test.zip`
3. Manual verification: `find test/ -name "*.jpg" | wc -l`

### Issue: Not enough disk space

**Status:** Not an issue (794 GB available, need only 3 GB)
