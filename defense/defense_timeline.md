## RISK MANAGEMENT

### High-Risk Items (Mitigation Required)

**RISK 1: CelebA Dataset Download Failure**
- **Probability:** Medium (large file, server downtime possible)
- **Impact:** High (blocks multi-dataset validation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start download in Week 1 (earliest possible)
  - Use VPN if geo-restricted
  - Fallback: VGGFace2 subset (similar size and diversity)
- **Contingency timeline:** +2 weeks if fallback needed

**RISK 2: CFP-FP Dataset Unavailable**
- **Probability:** Medium (dataset may be taken offline)
- **Impact:** Medium (reduces dataset diversity from 3 to 2)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Alternative: Use CASIA-WebFace (pose variation)
  - Preemptive check: Verify CFP-FP availability in Week 1
- **Contingency:** Proceed with LFW + CelebA only (still 2 diverse datasets)

**RISK 3: GPU Compute Unavailable**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (cluster downtime, queue delays)
- **Impact:** High (blocks all experiments)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Reserve cloud GPU credits (AWS P3, Google Cloud TPU)
  - Budget: $500 for emergency cloud compute
  - Timeline buffer: +1 week for cloud setup if needed

### Medium-Risk Items (Monitor Closely)

**RISK 4: Committee Scheduling Conflicts**
- **Probability:** Medium (4-6 busy faculty, limited availability)
- **Impact:** Medium (delays defense by 1-2 weeks)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Send calendar invites 4-6 weeks in advance
  - Offer 3-4 date options
  - Coordinate with department admin early

**RISK 5: Proofreader Turnaround Delay**
- **Probability:** Low (professional services are reliable)
- **Impact:** Low (can self-proofread if necessary)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Submit to proofreader 2 weeks before deadline (buffer)
  - Fallback: Use Grammarly + self-review

### Low-Risk Items (Standard Precautions)

**RISK 6: LaTeX Compilation Errors**
- **Probability:** Low (already compiles to 409 pages)
- **Impact:** Low (debugging is straightforward)
- **Mitigation:** Compile frequently, version control with Git

**RISK 7: Equipment Failure on Defense Day**
- **Probability:** Very low (but high impact if occurs)
- **Impact:** High (interrupts defense)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Backup USB with PDF
  - Test equipment 1 day before
  - Have printed slides as fallback
