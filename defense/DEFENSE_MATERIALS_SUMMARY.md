3. **GPU compute unavailable** → Mitigation: AWS/GCP credits ($500 budget)

**Medium Risks:**
4. Committee scheduling conflicts → Mitigation: 4-6 week advance invites
5. Proofreader delay → Mitigation: Submit 2 weeks early, self-review fallback

**Low Risks:**
6. LaTeX errors → Mitigation: Frequent compilation, Git version control
7. Equipment failure → Mitigation: Backup USB, printed slides

## KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Most Challenging Anticipated Questions

**TOP 5 TOUGH QUESTIONS:**

1. **"Why only LFW dataset?"** (Proposal Defense)
   - **Answer:** Multi-dataset validation is Months 1-3 top priority, scripts ready
   - **Evidence:** CelebA downloading (ETA 2 weeks), CFP-FP planned
   - **Confidence:** Medium (depends on dataset availability)

2. **"Your entire approach is flawed—you're validating garbage with garbage"**
   - **Answer:** We validate attribution-model consistency, not model correctness (orthogonal questions)
   - **Evidence:** Forensic deployment requires attribution accuracy, not model perfection
   - **Confidence:** High (philosophical distinction is clear)

3. **"Why did Geodesic IG fail so badly?"**
   - **Answer:** Geometric mismatch (geodesic paths vs. cosine similarity)
   - **Evidence:** 100% FR (500/500), mean Δsim = 0.003 radians (below ε = 0.3)
   - **Confidence:** Very High (diagnostic power demonstrated)

4. **"Can you finish in 10 months?"**
   - **Answer:** YES, 730 hours budgeted (~18 hours/week), 270-hour buffer
   - **Evidence:** Detailed timeline (defense_timeline.md), risk mitigation
   - **Confidence:** High (90%+, assuming no major setbacks)

5. **"Your dissertation is 409 pages—that's too long"**
   - **Answer:** Rigorous proofs (Theorems 3.5-3.8), comprehensive appendices, reproducibility
   - **Evidence:** SHAP dissertation (387 pages), LIME dissertation (312 pages)
   - **Confidence:** Medium (committee preference varies, can shorten if requested)

### 2. Gaps in Current Results for Q&A

**IDENTIFIED GAPS (FOR FINAL DEFENSE):**

1. **Multi-dataset validation** (proposal gap)
   - **Status:** In progress (Months 1-3 timeline)
   - **Required for final defense:** CelebA + CFP-FP results in Table 6.1

2. **Multi-model validation** (proposal gap)
   - **Status:** Preliminary ResNet-50 results, VGG-Face planned
   - **Required for final defense:** Table 6.4 with 3 architectures

3. **Chapter 8** (proposal gap)
   - **Status:** Outlined (Agent 1), not written
   - **Required for final defense:** Complete 6-section chapter

4. **Higher-n statistical power** (nice-to-have)
   - **Status:** n=500 currently, n=5000 planned (Month 5)
   - **Required for final defense:** Narrower confidence intervals (optional but recommended)

5. **Human validation studies** (acknowledged limitation)
   - **Status:** NOT in scope (no IRB approval)
   - **Required for final defense:** Acknowledge in Chapter 8.4, position as future work

---

### 3. Confidence Level for Defenses

**PROPOSAL DEFENSE (3 Months):**
- **Preparation Confidence:** 90% (materials complete, timeline is feasible)
- **Content Confidence:** 85% (theory solid, preliminary results strong, but single-dataset is vulnerable)
- **Timeline Confidence:** 95% (130 hours over 12 weeks = very achievable)
- **Overall Pass Probability:** 90%+ (expected outcome: pass with revisions for multi-dataset work)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Single-dataset validation (LFW only) → Committee will ask "how do you know this generalizes?"
- Mitigation: Emphasize Months 1-3 multi-dataset plan, scripts ready, fallback options

---

**FINAL DEFENSE (10 Months):**
- **Preparation Confidence:** 85% (assumes multi-dataset validation succeeds)
- **Content Confidence:** 95% (all RQs answered, limitations acknowledged, contributions clear)
- **Timeline Confidence:** 85% (730 hours over 40 weeks, buffer for risks)
- **Overall Pass Probability:** 90%+ (expected outcome: pass with minor revisions)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- CelebA/CFP-FP dataset acquisition (HIGH RISK → mitigated with fallbacks)
- GPU compute availability (MEDIUM RISK → mitigated with cloud credits)
- No human validation (LOW RISK → acknowledged as limitation, positioned as future work)
