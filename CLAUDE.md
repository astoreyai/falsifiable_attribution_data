## KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Honest Claims Only
- ❌ No aspirational goals
- ❌ No industry validation without partners
- ❌ No human studies without IRB
- ✅ Only claim what can be proven with evidence

### 2. Systematic Execution
- Complete workflows in order (01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06)
- Use quality checklists at each phase
- Track progress continuously with TodoWrite

### 3. Template-Based Approach
- Don't start from scratch
- Fill in placeholders systematically
- Adapt for specific field as needed

### 4. Quality Focus
- Every claim needs citation or data
- All results must be reproducible
- Clear, rigorous writing
- Defense-ready from the start
