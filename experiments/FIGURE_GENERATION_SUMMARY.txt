1. Figure 6.1: Falsification Rate Comparison Bar Chart
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_1/figure_6_1_falsification_comparison.pdf
   Size: 19 KB
   Description: Grouped bar chart comparing falsification rates across three
                attribution methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) with 95% confidence
                intervals. Shows all methods have similar performance around
                46-52% with no statistically significant differences.

2. Figure 6.2: Separation Margin vs Falsification Rate
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_2/figure_6_2_margin_analysis.pdf
   Size: 27 KB
   Description: Scatter plot with regression line showing relationship between
                separation margin (δ) and falsification rate across 4 strata.
                Demonstrates strong positive correlation (R²=0.985) with bubble
                size proportional to sample size and error bars showing 95% CI.

3. Figure 6.3: Attribute Falsifiability Heatmap
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_3/figure_6_3_attribute_heatmap.pdf
   Size: 45 KB
   Description: Categorical heatmap displaying falsification rates for top 10
                facial attributes organized by category (Expression, Demographic,
                Occlusion, Geometric). Uses YlOrRd colormap with value labels.
                Shows Expression (Smiling: 68.7%) and Demographic (Male: 67.3%)
                have highest falsifiability.

4. Figure 6.4: Model-Agnostic Comparison
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_4/figure_6_4_model_agnostic.pdf
   Size: 21 KB
   Description: Grouped bar chart comparing Grad-CAM vs SHAP across three face
                recognition architectures (ArcFace, CosFace, SphereFace). Shows
                SHAP is more model-agnostic with consistent performance, while
                Grad-CAM varies significantly across models. n=500 pairs per model.

5. Figure 6.5a: Convergence Curves
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_5/figure_6_5_convergence_curves.pdf
   Size: 66 KB
   Description: Shows convergence of falsification rate estimates as sample
                size increases, demonstrating statistical reliability.

6. Figure 6.5b: Sample Size Analysis
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_5/figure_6_5_sample_size.pdf
   Size: 20 KB
   Description: Sample size requirements for different precision levels.
                Shows n=221 needed for ±5% margin of error at 95% confidence.

7. Figure 6.6: Method Comparison
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_6/figure_6_6_method_comparison.pdf
   Size: 37 KB
   Description: Comprehensive comparison of different validation approaches.

8. Figure 6.8: Demographic Fairness Analysis
   File: /home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_6/figure_6_8_demographic_fairness.pdf
   Size: 40 KB
   Description: Analysis of falsification rates across demographic groups,
                demonstrating fairness across protected attributes.

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
================================================================================

Issue 1: Missing seaborn library
Status: RESOLVED
Solution: Removed seaborn dependency, used matplotlib only

Issue 2: Times New Roman font not available
Status: MINOR (non-blocking)
Impact: Figures use DejaVu Sans instead
Solution: Figures remain publication-quality; optionally install msttcorefonts
