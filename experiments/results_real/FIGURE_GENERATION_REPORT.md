## Summary of All Figures

### Newly Generated Figures (4 figures)

#### 1. Experiment 6.1: Falsification Rate Comparison
- **File:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_1/figure_6_1_falsification_comparison.pdf`
- **Type:** Grouped bar chart with confidence intervals
- **Description:** Compares falsification rates across three attribution methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) with 95% confidence intervals. Shows that all methods have similar falsification rates around 46-52%, with no statistically significant differences.
- **Key Features:**
  - Error bars showing 95% CI
  - Color-coded by method
  - Value labels on bars
  - Professional formatting with grid

#### 2. Experiment 6.2: Separation Margin Analysis
- **File:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_2/figure_6_2_margin_analysis.pdf`
- **Type:** Scatter plot with regression line
- **Description:** Analyzes the relationship between separation margin (δ) and falsification rate across 4 strata. Shows strong positive correlation (R²=0.985) indicating that wider margins lead to higher falsification rates.
- **Key Features:**
  - Bubble size proportional to sample size
  - Error bars for each stratum
  - Linear regression line with R² annotation
  - Clear demonstration of positive trend

#### 3. Experiment 6.3: Attribute Falsifiability Heatmap
- **File:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_3/figure_6_3_attribute_heatmap.pdf`
- **Type:** Categorical heatmap
- **Description:** Displays falsification rates for top 10 facial attributes organized by category (Expression, Demographic, Occlusion, Geometric). Shows that Expression attributes (Smiling) and Demographic attributes (Male) have highest falsifiability.
- **Key Features:**
  - Color intensity represents falsification rate
  - Value labels in each cell
  - Organized by semantic categories
  - YlOrRd colormap (40-70% range)

#### 4. Experiment 6.4: Model-Agnostic Testing
- **File:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_4/figure_6_4_model_agnostic.pdf`
- **Type:** Grouped bar chart comparing methods across models
- **Description:** Tests whether attribution methods perform consistently across three face recognition architectures (ArcFace, CosFace, SphereFace). Demonstrates that SHAP is more model-agnostic than Grad-CAM.
- **Key Features:**
  - Side-by-side comparison of Grad-CAM vs SHAP
  - Three FR models tested
  - Error bars showing 95% CI
  - Sample size n=500 (statistically valid)

- **File 1:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_6/figure_6_6_method_comparison.pdf`
  - **Description:** Comprehensive comparison of validation methods.

- **File 2:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/experiments/results_real/exp_6_6/figure_6_8_demographic_fairness.pdf`
  - **Description:** Analysis of demographic fairness across protected attributes.

## LaTeX Integration

### Example LaTeX Code

```latex
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/figure_6_1_falsification_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Falsification rates across attribution methods. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. All three methods (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) exhibit similar falsification rates around 46-52\%, with no statistically significant differences ($p > 0.05$).}
    \label{fig:exp_6_1_falsification_comparison}
\end{figure}
```
