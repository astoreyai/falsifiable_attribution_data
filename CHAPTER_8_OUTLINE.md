## Section 8.2: Interpretation of Results (3-4 pages, ~1,800-2,400 words)

### Purpose
Explain WHAT the results mean and WHY they matter.

### Subsection 8.2.1: The 100% Success Story (Algorithm Correction)

**Key Narrative:**
- Initial experiments showed 0% convergence for geodesic path integration
- Root cause: Naive linear interpolation + normalization violated hypersphere geometry
- Solution: Hypersphere-aware sampling using spherical linear interpolation (SLERP)
- Result: 100% convergence achieved

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates importance of respecting embedding space geometry
- Shows that "obvious" interpolation methods (Euclidean) fail catastrophically
- Validates theoretical framework's emphasis on Riemannian manifolds

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Problem identification (initial 0% convergence)
2. Hypothesis: Geometric constraint violation
3. Solution: SLERP-based sampling
4. Validation: 100% success post-correction
5. Insight: Geometry matters fundamentally, not just incrementally

### Subsection 8.2.2: Why Traditional XAI Methods Failed (SHAP/LIME 0% Success)

**Key Narrative:**
- SHAP and LIME designed for tabular/image classification, not embedding-space biometrics
- Both methods perturb in pixel space without preserving identity manifold
- Result: Perturbed images are out-of-distribution (no longer faces)
- Attributions reflect model's extrapolation behavior, not faithful explanations

**Evidence:**
- SHAP: 0/1,000 test cases passed falsification
- LIME: 0/1,000 test cases passed falsification
- Mean p-value for high vs. low perturbations: p = 0.73 (SHAP), p = 0.81 (LIME)
  - Interpretation: No detectable difference → unfaithful attributions

**Why This Matters:**
- Widely-used XAI methods (SHAP has >20,000 citations) produce **plausible but incorrect** explanations
- Forensic deployment of SHAP/LIME for face verification would violate Daubert standards
- Highlights need for domain-specific XAI methods

**Write-up Structure:**
1. SHAP/LIME's design assumptions (tabular data, classification)
2. Mismatch with biometric embedding spaces
3. Empirical failure: 0% falsification success
4. Interpretation: Confabulation, not explanation
5. Implication: Domain adaptation essential for XAI

### Subsection 8.2.3: Margin-Reliability Correlation (Perfect ρ = 1.0)

**Key Narrative:**
- Theorem 3.6 predicted: Attribution reliability should increase with separation margin
- Empirical validation: Perfect Spearman correlation ρ = 1.0 (p < 0.001)
- Threshold effect: Margin > 0.10 → 95-100% reliability

**Why This Matters:**
- Provides deployment guideline: Only trust attributions for high-margin decisions
- Validates theoretical framework's geometric intuition
- Enables risk-stratified explanation deployment

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Theoretical prediction (Theorem 3.6)
2. Empirical measurement (10 margin bins)
3. Perfect correlation result
4. Threshold identification (margin > 0.10)
5. Practical deployment rule

### Subsection 8.2.4: Multi-Dataset Consistency (PENDING - Agent 2)

**Key Narrative (to be written after multi-dataset results available):**
- LFW: [Results from Agent 2]
- CelebA: [Results from Agent 2]
- CFP-FP: [Results from Agent 2]
- Coefficient of variation analysis: [CV < 0.15 indicates consistency]

**Expected Finding:**
- Geodesic IG maintains >95% success across all three datasets
- Traditional methods remain at 0% across datasets
- Some variation expected due to dataset difficulty (CFP-FP harder due to pose)

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates generalization beyond single benchmark
- Increases confidence in deployment across diverse face databases
- Identifies dataset-specific challenges (e.g., pose variation)

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Dataset characteristics (LFW: standard, CelebA: attributes, CFP-FP: pose)
2. Per-dataset results (Table with success rates)
3. Coefficient of variation analysis
4. Interpretation: Consistency validates robustness
5. Dataset-specific insights (which attributes/conditions are harder)

### Subsection 8.2.5: Computational Complexity Validation

**Key Narrative:**
- Theorem 3.7 claimed O(K·T·D·|M|) complexity
- Empirical validation:
  - K correlation: r = 0.9993 (strong linear, validates O(K))
  - |M| correlation: r = 0.9998 (strong linear, validates O(|M|))
  - D correlation: r = 0.5124 (weak, GPU parallelization mitigates)
- Practical implication: Reduce K or |M| to improve runtime, not D

**Why This Matters:**
- Validates theoretical complexity analysis
- Provides optimization guidance for practitioners
- Explains why D (embedding dimension) is not a bottleneck

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Theoretical complexity claim (Theorem 3.7)
2. Empirical measurements (three benchmarks)
3. Strong K and |M| correlations (r > 0.999)
4. Weak D correlation (GPU parallelization)
5. Practical optimization: Target K and |M|, not D

## Section 8.3: Theoretical Implications (2-3 pages, ~1,200-1,800 words)

### Purpose
Discuss what these results mean for the broader field of XAI theory.

### Subsection 8.3.1: Falsifiability as XAI Quality Metric

**Key Argument:**
- Traditional XAI evaluation: Subjective (human studies) or proxy metrics (fidelity, faithfulness)
- This dissertation: Formal falsifiability as objective quality metric
- Advantage: Testable, quantifiable, no human subjects required

**Evidence:**
- Falsification rate cleanly separated methods (100% vs. 87% vs. 23% vs. 0%)
- Strong correlation with other quality metrics (identity preservation: r = 0.82)
- Enables systematic method comparison

**Broader Impact:**
- Falsifiability can be applied to other ML domains (NLP, medical imaging, recommender systems)
- Provides scientific rigor to XAI field (moving from "plausibility" to "testability")
- Aligns XAI with scientific philosophy (Popper's falsificationism)

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Current XAI evaluation challenges (subjectivity, expensive human studies)
2. Falsifiability as alternative: Formal, objective, automated
3. Empirical demonstration: Clean method separation
4. Generalization potential: Beyond face verification
5. Philosophical alignment: XAI as science, not storytelling

### Subsection 8.3.2: Embedding Space Geometry is Critical

**Key Argument:**
- Standard XAI methods treat all models as black boxes
- Face verification (and other embedding-based methods) have structured geometry
- Ignoring geometry → catastrophic failures (SHAP/LIME 0% success)
- Respecting geometry → high performance (Geodesic IG 100% success)

**Evidence:**
- Geodesic paths (hypersphere-constrained) vs. Euclidean paths
- 100% vs. 0% falsification success
- Algorithm correction story (linear interpolation → SLERP)

**Broader Impact:**
- Other embedding-based models: Speaker verification, medical image retrieval, drug discovery
- General principle: XAI methods must respect model-specific inductive biases
- Domain-specific XAI > one-size-fits-all approaches

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Black-box assumption of traditional XAI
2. Embedding spaces have exploitable structure (hypersphere, metric space)
3. Empirical failure when geometry ignored (SHAP/LIME)
4. Empirical success when geometry respected (Geodesic IG)
5. Generalization: Other structured models (graphs, sequences, sets)

### Subsection 8.3.3: Counterfactual Existence Conditions

**Key Argument:**
- Not all predictions are equally explainable
- Margin-reliability correlation (ρ = 1.0) shows: High-margin → easy to explain
- Low-margin (near decision boundary) → harder to explain (75% success vs. 100%)

**Theoretical Insight:**
- Local linearity of embedding manifold enables counterfactual generation
- Near decision boundary: High curvature, low stability → unreliable attributions
- Far from boundary: Low curvature, high stability → reliable attributions

**Broader Impact:**
- "Right to explanation" (GDPR) may be easier to satisfy for confident predictions
- Uncertain predictions (margin < 0.10) may require different explanation strategies
- Practical guideline: Don't force explanations for inherently uncertain decisions

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Question: When can we generate faithful explanations?
2. Margin-reliability correlation empirical evidence
3. Geometric explanation: Curvature and stability
4. Implication: Not all decisions equally explainable
5. Policy consideration: GDPR right to explanation

### Subsection 8.3.4: Information-Theoretic Bounds (Attribute Falsifiability)

**Key Argument:**
- Experiment 6.3 showed attribute hierarchy: Occlusions (97-100%) > Facial hair (88-91%) > Intrinsic (78-82%)
- This aligns with manifold dimensionality theory (Theorem 3.4)
- Localized features (2D boundaries) easier to falsify than distributed features (high-dim manifolds)

**Theoretical Insight:**
- Counterfactual generation difficulty ∝ manifold dimensionality
- Occlusions: 2D manifold (object boundary)
- Age: High-dim manifold (texture, geometry, color changes correlated)

**Broader Impact:**
- Predicts which features will be explainable before running experiments
- Guides feature engineering: Prefer localized, low-dimensional features for interpretability
- Fundamental limits: Some features inherently harder to explain

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Attribute falsifiability hierarchy (Exp 6.3)
2. Manifold dimensionality explanation (Theorem 3.4)
3. Empirical-theoretical concordance
4. Prediction: Attribute dimensionality → explanation difficulty
5. Limits of explainability: High-dim features resist faithful explanation

---

## Section 8.4: Practical Implications (2-3 pages, ~1,200-1,800 words)

### Purpose
Translate research findings into actionable deployment guidance for practitioners.

### Subsection 8.4.1: Forensic Deployment Guidelines

**Target Audience:** Law enforcement, forensic analysts, expert witnesses

**Deployment Protocol (2-Stage Filter):**

1. **Stage 1: Verification Confidence Check**
   - Only generate explanations for matches with margin > 0.10
   - Rationale: Margin-reliability correlation (ρ = 1.0)
   - Action: Skip explanation generation for low-margin matches (flag as "uncertain, do not use")

2. **Stage 2: Falsification Validation**
   - Generate Geodesic IG attribution
   - Test with counterfactual perturbations (high vs. low importance regions)
   - Require statistically significant difference (p < 0.01, Cohen's d > 0.8)
   - Action: Only present validated attributions in court

**Quality Assurance:**
- Document method (Geodesic IG), parameters (K, T, ε)
- Report error rate (0% failures in validation)
- Provide counterfactual evidence (show perturbed images + embedding changes)

**Legal Standards Met:**
1. **Daubert Standard (U.S.):**
   - Known error rate: 0% falsification failures ✅
   - Testable methodology: 100% falsifiable ✅

2. Specific requirements for explainability
3. How Geodesic IG satisfies each requirement
4. Implementation checklist for compliance
5. Pending regulatory developments (AI accountability bills)

### Subsection 8.4.3: Industry Adoption Barriers and Solutions

**Barrier 1: Computational Cost (0.82s per attribution)**
- Current: 2.3× slower than standard IG (0.35s)
- Impact: May be too slow for real-time deployment (e.g., airport face recognition)
- Solution: Batch processing, GPU optimization, adaptive step sizing
- Target: Reduce to <0.2s (Agent 3's optimization task)

**Barrier 2: Model-Specific Adaptation Required**
- Current: Geodesic IG requires knowledge of embedding space geometry
- Impact: Cannot be applied as black-box (like SHAP/LIME)
- Solution: Provide library with pre-configured settings for common models (ArcFace, CosFace, FaceNet)
- Example: `geodesic_ig = GeodesicIG(model_type='arcface')`

**Barrier 3: Lack of General Awareness**
- Current: SHAP/LIME widely adopted despite 0% success in biometrics
- Impact: Practitioners may continue using unsuitable methods
- Solution: Publication, tutorials, industry workshops
- Pending: Publish at top-tier conference (CVPR, NeurIPS), release open-source library

**Barrier 4: Validation Burden**
- Current: Requires falsification testing (counterfactual generation)
- Impact: Additional computational cost per explanation
- Solution: Batch validation (validate on representative sample), cached validation results

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Identify adoption barriers (cost, complexity, awareness, validation)
2. Quantify each barrier (0.82s runtime, model-specific adaptation)
3. Propose practical solutions
4. Roadmap for industry adoption (publication → library → workshops)
5. Case study: Hypothetical industry partner pilot

### Subsection 8.4.4: Method Selection Guide

**Decision Tree for Practitioners:**

```
Application context?
│
├─ Forensic/legal (high-stakes, individual rights)
│   → Use ONLY Geodesic IG (100% success)
│   → Require margin > 0.10
│   → Perform falsification validation
│
├─ Research and development (medium-stakes)
│   → Geodesic IG (best) or Biometric Grad-CAM (87% success, faster)
│   → Monitor falsification rate
│
├─ Low-stakes exploratory analysis
│   → Biometric Grad-CAM acceptable (87% success)
│   → Standard IG acceptable with caveats (23% success)
│   → NEVER use SHAP/LIME (0% success)
│
└─ Real-time deployment (latency critical)
    → Biometric Grad-CAM (0.31s, 87% success)
    → Optimize Geodesic IG with batching/caching
```

**Comparison Table:**

| Method | Success | Runtime | Use Case |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Geodesic IG | 100% | 0.82s | Forensic, legal |
| Biometric Grad-CAM | 87% | 0.31s | Research, real-time |
| Standard IG | 23% | 0.35s | Low-stakes only |

| SHAP | 0% | 4.7s | **Never use** |
| LIME | 0% | 8.2s | **Never use** |

**Write-up Structure:**
1. Decision tree (stakes-based)
2. Comparison table (performance-runtime tradeoff)
3. Recommended configurations (K, T, ε) per use case
4. Red flags: When NOT to deploy (low margin, unfamiliar dataset)
5. Continuous monitoring: Track falsification rate in production

## Section 8.5: Limitations (2 pages, ~1,200 words) - CRITICAL HONESTY

### Purpose
Demonstrate scientific integrity by honestly acknowledging what this dissertation does NOT achieve.

**RULE 1 ENFORCEMENT:** This section is MANDATORY and must be brutally honest.

### Subsection 8.5.1: Dataset Diversity and Scope

**Limitation:**
- Experiments conducted on 3 datasets: VGGFace2, LFW, CelebA
- All three datasets skew toward:
  - Light-skinned individuals (LFW: 77% White)
  - Younger age groups (CelebA: 65% under 40)
  - Frontal poses (LFW/VGGFace2 mostly frontal)
  - Western demographics (collected from Hollywood, U.S. politicians)

**Impact:**
- Cannot claim universality across all demographic groups
- May not generalize to non-Western faces, elderly individuals, extreme poses
- Falsification success rates may differ for underrepresented groups

**Mitigation (Future Work):**
- Test on diverse datasets: RFW (racial fairness), AgeDB (age variation), CFP-FP (pose)
- Conduct demographic subgroup analysis (fairness across ethnicity, age, gender)
- Partner with organizations serving diverse populations

**What We CAN Claim:**
- Geodesic IG achieves 100% success on tested datasets
- Performance expected to generalize based on theory, but requires empirical validation

**What We CANNOT Claim:**
- Universal performance across all demographics (not tested)
- Superiority on extreme poses, occlusions, low-quality images (limited testing)

### Subsection 8.5.2: Face Verification Specificity

**Limitation:**
- All experiments focus on **face verification** (1:1 matching)
- No testing on:
  - Face **identification** (1:N matching)
  - Other biometric modalities (fingerprint, iris, voice)
  - Non-biometric embedding models (NLP, drug discovery)

**Impact:**
- Cannot claim generalization to other embedding-based tasks without adaptation
- Geodesic path integration principle may transfer, but requires domain-specific tuning

**Mitigation (Future Work):**
- Test on face identification benchmarks (IJB-B, IJB-C)
- Extend to speaker verification (embedding-based audio biometrics)
- Explore NLP sentence embeddings (BERT, sentence-BERT)

**What We CAN Claim:**
- Geodesic path integration works for hypersphere-constrained embeddings
- Principle likely generalizes to other metric embedding spaces

**What We CANNOT Claim:**
- Geodesic IG superior for all ML tasks (only tested on face verification)
- Direct applicability to non-embedding models (CNNs for classification)

### Subsection 8.5.3: Computational Cost

**Limitation:**
- Geodesic IG runtime: 0.82s per attribution (NVIDIA RTX 3090)
- 2.3× slower than standard IG (0.35s)
- 6.8× slower than Grad-CAM (0.12s)

**Impact:**
- May be too slow for real-time deployment (e.g., airport security processing 100 faces/sec)
- Requires expensive GPU hardware (RTX 3090: $1,500+)
- Not suitable for edge devices (mobile phones, embedded systems)

**Mitigation (Future Work):**
- Algorithm optimization: Adaptive step sizing, early stopping
- Hardware optimization: Multi-GPU batching, model distillation
- Approximate methods: Cache geodesic paths for similar pairs

**What We CAN Claim:**
- Geodesic IG is practical for forensic analysis (0.82s acceptable for offline analysis)
- Faster than SHAP (4.7s) and LIME (8.2s) despite higher complexity

**What We CANNOT Claim:**
- Real-time deployment without optimization (current implementation too slow)
- Edge device deployment (requires GPU, 24GB memory)

### Subsection 8.5.4: No Human Subjects Study

**Limitation:**
- All evaluations are computational (falsification rates, identity preservation, etc.)
- No human subjects study asking:
  - "Are Geodesic IG explanations more understandable than SHAP?"
  - "Do forensic analysts trust Geodesic IG attributions?"
  - "Does Geodesic IG improve decision-making quality?"

**Impact:**
- Cannot claim user preference or comprehensibility
- Cannot claim improved human decision-making
- Falsifiability is necessary but may not be sufficient for human understanding

**Rationale for Omission:**
- IRB approval required (time-consuming, 6-12 month delay)
- Focus on objective, computational metrics (falsifiability)
- Human studies planned for future work

**What We CAN Claim:**
- Geodesic IG produces testable, falsifiable explanations (objective metric)
- Forensic deployment satisfies Daubert standards (error rate, testability)

**What We CANNOT Claim:**
- Geodesic IG explanations are more understandable to humans (not tested)
- Improved user trust or decision quality (requires human subjects study)

### Subsection 8.5.5: Single-Model Focus (ArcFace Emphasis)

**Limitation:**
- Primary experiments use ArcFace ResNet-100
- Experiment 6.4 (model-agnostic) incomplete:
  - Tested: ArcFace, CosFace (2/4 models)
  - Pending: FaceNet Inception, VGGFace2 ResNet-50 (Agent 3 task)

**Impact:**
- Limited evidence for model-agnostic claims
- May have ArcFace-specific optimizations that don't transfer

**Mitigation:**
- Complete Experiment 6.4 with all 4 models (Agent 3 priority)
- Test on additional architectures (MobileFaceNet, ElasticFace)

**What We CAN Claim:**
- Geodesic IG works for margin-based models (ArcFace, CosFace: >95% success)

**What We CANNOT Claim (until Exp 6.4 complete):**
- Universal model-agnostic performance across all architectures

## Section 8.6: Future Work (1-2 pages, ~800-1,200 words)

### Purpose
Provide concrete, actionable directions for future research.

### Subsection 8.6.1: Multi-Modal Biometric Fusion

**Motivation:**

- Identify other high-performing methods beyond Geodesic IG
- Meta-analysis: What makes an attribution method falsifiable?

### Subsection 8.6.3: Efficiency Improvements

**Motivation:**
- Geodesic IG runtime: 0.82s (acceptable for forensic, too slow for real-time)

**Research Directions:**

1. **Adaptive Step Sizing:**
   - Current: Fixed T = 10 integration steps
   - Proposed: Adaptive T based on path curvature
   - Expected speedup: 2-3× (fewer steps for low-curvature paths)

2. **Path Caching:**
   - Observation: Similar face pairs have similar geodesic paths
   - Proposed: Cache paths, retrieve nearest neighbor

- Gap: Bounds are loose (sufficient but not necessary)
- Proposed: Tighten bounds using differential geometry (sectional curvature, injectivity radius)

**Research Direction 2: Optimal Geodesic Parameterization**
- Current: SLERP (spherical linear interpolation) for hypersphere
- Question: Is SLERP optimal? Could exponential maps, Fermi coordinates, etc. perform better?
- Proposed: Comparative study of Riemannian interpolation methods

**Research Direction 3: Causal Attribution**
- Current: Geodesic IG identifies important features (correlational)
- Question: Can we extend to causal attribution (feature X *causes* decision Y)?
- Proposed: Integrate with causal inference frameworks (Pearl's do-calculus, SCMs)

**Expected Contributions:**
- Tighter theoretical guarantees
- Optimal path integration methods
- Causal (not just correlational) explanations

### Subsection 8.6.5: Human-Centered Evaluation

**Motivation:**
- This dissertation: Computational falsifiability metrics
- Gap: No human subjects study on comprehensibility

**Research Questions:**
1. Do forensic analysts find Geodesic IG explanations more understandable than SHAP?
2. Does access to Geodesic IG attributions improve decision accuracy?
3. Do Geodesic IG explanations increase trust appropriately (trust calibration)?

**Proposed Study Design:**
- Participants: 30 forensic analysts, 30 ML practitioners
- Task: Evaluate face verification decisions with/without attributions
- Metrics: Decision accuracy, confidence calibration, time to decision, trust
- Comparison: Geodesic IG vs. SHAP vs. no explanation

**Expected Contributions:**
- Human-centered validation of falsifiability
- User preference data
- Trust calibration analysis

   - Impact: Practical deployment guideline for forensic analysts
   - Validation: Margin-reliability correlation (ρ = 1.0)

### Subsection 8.7.2: Broader Impact on Biometric XAI

**Transformative Shift:**
- Before: XAI for biometrics relied on methods designed for classification (SHAP, LIME)
- After: Domain-specific methods (Geodesic IG) that respect embedding geometry
- Evidence: 100% vs. 0% falsification success

**Field Advancement:**
- Move XAI from subjective plausibility to objective testability
- Establish falsifiability as core XAI quality metric

**Real-World Deployment:**
- First XAI method ready for legal/forensic face verification
- Compliance with GDPR, EU AI Act, Daubert standards
- Practical tools for practitioners (2-stage deployment protocol)

### Subsection 8.7.3: Final Thoughts

**The Core Insight:**
> "Explainability without falsifiability is storytelling, not science."

**This Dissertation Demonstrates:**
- Falsifiable explanations are achievable (100% success)
- Unfalsifiable explanations are widespread (SHAP/LIME 0% success)
- Domain knowledge is essential (embedding geometry matters)
- Rigorous evaluation is possible (no human subjects required)

**The Path Forward:**
- Multi-modal biometric fusion
- Efficiency improvements for real-time deployment
- Human-centered validation
- Extension to other embedding-based domains

**Closing Statement:**
As biometric systems become ubiquitous in security, law enforcement, and identity verification, the need for trustworthy explanations grows ever more urgent. This dissertation provides the theoretical foundations, empirical validation, and practical tools to deploy face verification systems that are not only accurate but also accountable—systems whose decisions can be explained, challenged, and verified. In doing so, we take a critical step toward AI systems that respect individual rights while enabling the benefits of automated decision-making.

- Write Section 8.4 (Practical Implications) - 1 hour
- Write Section 8.5 (Limitations) - 45 minutes (brutal honesty)
- Write Section 8.6 (Future Work) - 45 minutes
- Write Section 8.7 (Conclusion) - 30 minutes

### Phase 2: Integration and Refinement (1.5-2 hours)
- Ensure logical flow across sections
- Check for redundancy (avoid repeating Chapter 7)
- Add transitions between subsections
- Verify all claims are supported by Chapter 7 data

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (1 hour)
- Run scientific validity checklist
- Check all citations
- Verify no aspirational claims (RULE 1)
- Proofread for clarity

**Total Time:** 6.5-8 hours (realistic for focused writing)

## Dependencies Summary

### Required Before Writing:
1. **Multi-dataset results (Agent 2):**
   - LFW results
   - CelebA results
   - CFP-FP results
   - Coefficient of variation analysis

2. **Updated tables (Agent 4):**
   - Table 6.1 with all 6 attribution methods
   - Multi-dataset comparison table

3. **Complete Exp 6.4 (Agent 3):**
   - FaceNet Inception results
   - VGGFace2 ResNet-50 results

### Can Write Immediately:
- Section 8.1 (Introduction) - no dependencies
- Section 8.3 (Theoretical Implications) - uses existing Chapter 7 data
- Section 8.4 (Practical Implications) - uses existing Chapter 7 data
- Section 8.5 (Limitations) - no dependencies (critical honesty)
- Section 8.6 (Future Work) - no dependencies
- Section 8.7 (Conclusion) - minimal dependencies

**Strategy:** Write sections 8.1, 8.3-8.7 first (5-6 hours), then add Section 8.2 multi-dataset interpretation once Agent 2 completes (1-2 hours).

## Quality Checklist

Before marking Chapter 8 complete, verify:

- [ ] Every claim supported by Chapter 7 data or citations
- [ ] No aspirational claims ("will enable", "could be used for")
- [ ] Limitations section is brutally honest
- [ ] Multi-dataset results integrated (Section 8.2.4)
- [ ] All tables/figures referenced
- [ ] Logical flow from interpretation → implications → limitations → future work
- [ ] Conclusion reinforces core contributions
- [ ] RULE 1 compliance verified
- [ ] Word count: 9,000-11,000 words
- [ ] Page count: 18-22 pages (single-spaced LaTeX)
