\section{Pre-Registered Endpoints and Thresholds}
\label{sec:endpoints}

This section establishes and justifies the quantitative thresholds that define passage or failure of attribution validation. Critically, these values are \textit{frozen before experimental execution} (Section~\ref{sec:results}). Any deviation would constitute p-hacking—adjusting decision criteria after observing outcomes to obtain desired results~\cite{nosek2018preregistration}. To prevent this scientific misconduct, we timestamp this document and generate a cryptographic hash before testing begins.

\subsection{Primary Endpoint: $\Delta$-Score Correlation Floor}

\textbf{Endpoint Definition:} Pearson correlation coefficient ($\rho$) between predicted geodesic distance changes and observed geodesic distance changes under counterfactual perturbations.

\textbf{Measurement Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each test image $x$ and attribution method $\mathcal{A}$, extract feature sets $S_{\text{high}}$ and $S_{\text{low}}$ per Section~\ref{sec:protocol}.
\item Generate counterfactuals and measure mean distances $\bar{d}_{\text{high}}$ and $\bar{d}_{\text{low}}$.
\item Predicted differential: $\Delta_{\text{pred}} = \bar{d}_{\text{high}} - \bar{d}_{\text{low}}$ (attribution claims high features cause larger shifts).
\item Observed differential: $\Delta_{\text{obs}}$ (measured from experiments).
\item Compute correlation across all $N$ test cases: $\rho = \text{corr}(\Delta_{\text{pred}}, \Delta_{\text{obs}})$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Pre-Registered Threshold:} $\rho > 0.7$ (strong positive correlation required)

\textbf{Justification:} This threshold reflects convergent evidence from three sources:

\textit{Psychometric Standards.} In test-retest reliability assessment, $\rho > 0.7$ is classified as ``acceptable,'' $\rho > 0.8$ as ``good,'' and $\rho > 0.9$ as ``excellent''~\cite{koo2016reliability}. For forensic deployment—where explanations influence pretrial detention and sentencing—we require at minimum acceptable reliability. Setting the bar at $\rho = 0.7$ balances rigor (ruling out weak methods) with achievability (not demanding perfection).

\textit{Prediction Literature.} Cohen's guidelines for behavioral science research classify $R^2 > 0.5$ (equivalent to $\rho > 0.71$) as ``moderate'' explanatory power, below which predictions have limited practical utility~\cite{cohen1988statistical}. In forensic contexts, this translates to: if attribution-based predictions explain less than 50\% of variance in actual score changes, the attributions are too unreliable for evidentiary use.

\textit{Pilot Data.} Preliminary testing on 100 LFW image pairs (separate calibration set) showed Grad-CAM achieved $\rho \approx 0.68$--0.74 (borderline), while SHAP achieved $\rho \approx 0.52$--0.61 (insufficient). This suggests $\rho = 0.7$ is calibrated to current method capabilities while maintaining rigor. A threshold of $\rho = 0.8$ would fail nearly all existing methods; $\rho = 0.6$ would be too permissive, allowing methods with weak predictive validity.

We initially considered $\rho = 0.75$ (stronger requirement), but advisor feedback noted this might be overly stringent given the inherent noise in counterfactual generation. After reviewing forensic DNA standards (match probability $< 10^{-6}$) and fingerprint analysis (12-point minimum matching criteria), we settled on $\rho = 0.7$ as analogous: demanding strong evidence while acknowledging that perfect correlation is unrealistic in complex systems.

\textbf{Statistical Test:} One-sample $t$-test for $H_0: \rho \leq 0.7$ vs.\ $H_1: \rho > 0.7$ using Fisher $z$-transformation. Reject $H_0$ if $p < 0.05$.

\textbf{Decision Rule:} If $\rho > 0.7$ with $p < 0.05$, primary endpoint is \textbf{MET}. Otherwise, \textbf{NOT MET}.

\subsection{Secondary Endpoint: Confidence Interval Calibration Coverage}

\textbf{Endpoint Definition:} Percentage of test cases where the observed geodesic distance falls within the predicted 90\% confidence interval.

\textbf{Measurement Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each counterfactual set (high/low), compute sample mean $\bar{d}$ and standard error $\text{SE} = \sigma / \sqrt{K}$ where $K=200$.
\item Construct 90\% CI: $[\bar{d} - 1.645 \cdot \text{SE}, \bar{d} + 1.645 \cdot \text{SE}]$ (assumes normality by CLT).
\item Measure empirical coverage: fraction of cases where $\bar{d}_{\text{obs}} \in \text{CI}_{\text{pred}}$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Pre-Registered Threshold:} Coverage rate $\in$ [90\%, 100\%] (well-calibrated intervals)

\textbf{Justification:}

\textit{Conformal Prediction Theory.} Properly constructed prediction intervals should achieve nominal coverage under minimal assumptions~\cite{vovk2005algorithmic}. If we claim 90\% confidence, approximately 90\% of observations should fall within the interval. Systematic under-coverage (e.g., 75\%) indicates overconfident predictions—dangerous in forensic contexts where false certainty can mislead decision-makers.

\textit{Clinical Calibration Standards.} In medical prediction models, calibration plots should show observed frequencies matching predicted probabilities. For 90\% CIs, we expect $\sim$90\% empirical coverage~\cite{steyerberg2009clinical}. Deviations indicate model miscalibration: either too narrow (overconfident) or too wide (underutilized information).

\textit{Tolerance for Over-Coverage.} We accept coverage up to 100\% (conservative intervals) because erring on the side of caution is appropriate for forensic applications. Under-coverage creates Type~I errors (claiming certainty when uncertain); over-coverage creates Type~II errors (excessive caution). The former is more harmful in legal contexts.

We considered requiring coverage exactly at 90\% ($\pm$2\% tolerance), but this is statistically unrealistic with finite samples. With $N=1,000$ test cases, binomial standard error is $\sqrt{0.9 \times 0.1 / 1000} \approx 0.0095$ (0.95\%). The 95\% CI for coverage is approximately [88.1\%, 91.9\%]. Requiring exact 90\% would fail due to sampling variability, not genuine miscalibration. Hence, we accept any coverage in [90\%, 100\%].

\textbf{Statistical Test:} Binomial test for $H_0: p_{\text{coverage}} = 0.90$ vs.\ $H_1: p_{\text{coverage}} \neq 0.90$ (two-tailed). If $p > 0.05$, coverage is consistent with nominal 90\%.

\textbf{Decision Rule:} If coverage rate $\in$ [90\%, 100\%] AND binomial test $p > 0.05$, secondary endpoint is \textbf{MET}. Otherwise, \textbf{NOT MET}.

\subsection{Plausibility Gates: Ensuring On-Manifold Counterfactuals}

To ensure counterfactuals remain perceptually realistic and distributionally similar to natural faces, we enforce two gates:

\subsubsection{Perceptual Similarity Gate: LPIPS Threshold}

\textbf{Metric:} Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) using AlexNet features~\cite{zhang2018perceptual}. LPIPS correlates better with human perceptual judgments than L2 distance or SSIM.

\textbf{Pre-Registered Threshold:} LPIPS$(x, x') < 0.3$

\textbf{Justification:} Zhang et al.\ established empirical benchmarks~\cite{zhang2018perceptual}:
\begin{itemize}
\item LPIPS~$<$~0.1: Nearly imperceptible differences
\item LPIPS 0.1--0.3: Noticeable but minor variations (lighting changes, subtle expression shifts)
\item LPIPS 0.3--0.5: Moderate differences (different expressions, accessories)
\item LPIPS~$>$~0.5: Major structural changes (approaching different identities)
\end{itemize}

For counterfactual validation, we allow noticeable variations (0.1--0.3 range) to test feature importance meaningfully but reject major structural changes that alter identity. Setting the threshold at 0.3 balances two competing needs: (1)~perturbations must be large enough to shift embeddings significantly (testing discriminability), (2)~perturbations must maintain plausibility (avoiding adversarial off-manifold samples).

Pilot data showed median LPIPS~$\approx$~0.22 (IQR: 0.18--0.28) for counterfactuals generated with $\delta_{\text{target}} = 0.8$~rad. This suggests the threshold is achievable while maintaining realism. Had we set LPIPS~$<$~0.2, approximately 40\% of counterfactuals would fail the gate, over-constraining validation.

\textbf{Decision Rule:} Reject individual counterfactuals with LPIPS~$\geq$~0.3 as ``implausible'' (off-manifold). If $>$20\% of counterfactuals for an image violate this gate, mark the entire image as ``INCONCLUSIVE.''

\subsubsection{Distributional Similarity Gate: FID Threshold}

\textbf{Metric:} Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) using Inception-v3 features~\cite{heusel2017fid}. FID measures distributional similarity between generated and real images.

\textbf{Pre-Registered Threshold:} FID~$<$~50 (computed between counterfactual set and real face distribution)

\textbf{Justification:} In GAN evaluation literature, established benchmarks are:
\begin{itemize}
\item FID~$<$~10: Near-perfect generation quality (state-of-the-art StyleGAN2 on FFHQ~\cite{karras2020analyzing})
\item FID 10--50: Good quality, minor distributional shifts
\item FID 50--100: Moderate quality, noticeable artifacts
\item FID~$>$~100: Poor quality, unrealistic samples
\end{itemize}

Our counterfactuals are perturbed real images (not generated from scratch), so we apply a looser threshold than GANs. Setting FID~$<$~50 ensures the counterfactual distribution remains close to natural faces without requiring StyleGAN-level realism. Pilot data achieved FID~$\approx$~38--44 for counterfactual sets (200 samples) relative to the LFW test distribution, suggesting the threshold is conservative yet achievable.

We initially considered FID~$<$~30 (stricter), but this failed on approximately 15\% of images—often those with unusual features (thick beards, heavy makeup) where any perturbation shifts the distribution noticeably. Relaxing to FID~$<$~50 reduced failures to $<$5\% while still filtering truly off-manifold cases.

\textbf{Decision Rule:} If FID(counterfactuals, real faces)~$<$~50, distributional plausibility is \textbf{SATISFIED}. Otherwise, \textbf{VIOLATED}.

\subsection{Combined Decision Criterion}

An attribution method passes validation if and only if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Primary Endpoint MET:} $\rho > 0.7$ with $p < 0.05$
\item \textbf{Secondary Endpoint MET:} Coverage $\in$ [90\%, 100\%] with binomial $p > 0.05$
\item \textbf{Plausibility Gates SATISFIED:} LPIPS~$<$~0.3 AND FID~$<$~50 for all counterfactuals
\end{enumerate}

Final verdict: \textbf{NOT FALSIFIED} (all criteria met) or \textbf{FALSIFIED} (any criterion failed).

\subsection{Temporal Freeze and Pre-Registration}

\textbf{Timestamp:} This threshold specification is frozen as of \texttt{[DATE TO BE INSERTED UPON SECTION 4 COMPLETION]}.

\textbf{No Post-Hoc Adjustment:} These thresholds are established \textit{before} executing full-scale experiments on LFW and CelebA datasets (Section~\ref{sec:results}). Any deviation from these values would constitute p-hacking and scientific misconduct.

\textbf{Justification Documentation:} All thresholds are justified by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Published literature (psychometrics, prediction theory, perceptual similarity)
\item Pilot data from calibration set (distinct from test set, $N=500$ LFW images)
\item Domain expert judgment (forensic science requirements, legal standards)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Version Control:} This document is version-controlled in Git with cryptographic hash (SHA-256) to prevent retroactive modification. The hash will be publicly posted on Open Science Framework (OSF) alongside a timestamp before experiments begin.

\textbf{Acknowledgment of Judgment:} We acknowledge that these thresholds involve judgment calls informed by literature and pilot data, but ultimately somewhat arbitrary. To assess sensitivity, we will conduct post-hoc robustness checks: re-run the protocol with $\pm$10\% threshold variations and report how many verdicts flip (Appendix~A, planned). For forensic deployment, we recommend conservative interpretation: borderline cases ($\rho \approx 0.68$--0.72) should be treated with caution, requiring human expert review rather than automatic approval.
