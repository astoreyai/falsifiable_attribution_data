## FROZEN THRESHOLD VALUES AND RATIONALE

### Critical Decision Thresholds (Pre-Registered)

| Threshold | Value | Rationale | Source |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **$\rho_{\text{min}}$** (Correlation Floor) | 0.7 | Cohen (1988): R²>0.5 is "moderate"; psychometric standards (Koo & Li 2016): ρ>0.7 is "acceptable" reliability | Literature + Pilot Data (ρ≈0.68-0.74) |
| **Coverage Range** | 90-100% | Conformal prediction theory (Vovk et al. 2005): nominal coverage should match empirical; under-coverage indicates overconfidence | Theoretical + Standards |
| **$\tau_{\text{high}}$** (High-Attr. Distance Floor) | 0.75 rad | Masking important features prevents reaching δ_target=0.8; pilot data shows d̄_high∈[0.75,0.85] | Pilot Data (N=500 calibration) |
| **$\tau_{\text{low}}$** (Low-Attr. Distance Ceiling) | 0.55 rad | Masking unimportant features allows reaching/exceeding target; pilot data shows d̄_low∈[0.50,0.60] | Pilot Data (N=500 calibration) |
| **$\epsilon$** (Separation Margin) | 0.15 rad | Ensures meaningful distinction: τ_high - τ_low = 0.20 > ε; corresponds to Δcos≈0.05, ~8.6° angular difference | Theoretical (Minimum Detectable Effect) |
| **$\theta_{\text{high}}$** (High-Attr. Threshold) | 0.7 | 70th percentile of \|φ\| distribution on calibration set; ensures ~30% features classified as high-attribution | Calibration Set Empirical Distribution |
| **$\theta_{\text{low}}$** (Low-Attr. Threshold) | 0.4 | 40th percentile of \|φ\| distribution on calibration set; ensures ~40% features classified as low-attribution | Calibration Set Empirical Distribution |
| **LPIPS** (Perceptual Similarity) | < 0.3 | Zhang et al. (2018): LPIPS 0.1-0.3 is "minor variations"; >0.3 is "moderate differences" | Literature + Pilot (median=0.22) |
| **FID** (Distributional Similarity) | < 50 | Heusel et al. (2017): FID<50 is "good quality" for generative models; looser than GANs (counterfactuals are perturbed real) | Literature + Pilot (FID≈38-44) |
| **$\delta_{\text{target}}$** (Target Distance) | 0.8 rad | ArcFace verification boundary: d_g<0.6 is "same", d_g>1.0 is "different"; 0.8 is boundary region (cosine≈0.697) | ArcFace Decision Boundary Analysis |
| **K** (Sample Size) | 200 | Hoeffding's inequality: K=200 provides estimation error ε<0.1 rad with 95% confidence | Statistical Power Analysis |
| **α_corrected** (Significance Level) | 0.025 | Bonferroni correction: α=0.05/2=0.025 for two tests; controls family-wise error rate | Multiple Testing Correction |

**Pre-Registration Commitment:**
- ✅ All thresholds frozen as of document creation date
- ✅ SHA-256 hash to be generated upon finalization
- ✅ Public timestamp via OSF or AsPredicted
- ✅ NO post-hoc adjustment permitted after test set execution
- ✅ Any deviations must be documented with justification
