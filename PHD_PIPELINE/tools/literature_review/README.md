# Literature Review Tools

**Purpose:** Support systematic, reproducible literature reviews following PRISMA guidelines

---

## üöÄ NEW: Automated Scopus Pipeline

**Want to save 90% of time on literature searches?**

We now provide a **fully automated Scopus search pipeline** that:
- ‚úÖ Executes searches via Scopus API with full documentation
- ‚úÖ Exports to BibTeX, RIS, CSV automatically
- ‚úÖ Deduplicates papers with confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Updates PRISMA diagram automatically
- ‚úÖ Generates complete execution logs for reproducibility

**üìñ Quick Start:** See [`automated_scopus/README.md`](automated_scopus/README.md)

**üìñ Integration Guide:** See [`AUTOMATED_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`](AUTOMATED_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**Time Saved:** Manual = 1.5-2.5 hours per search session ‚Üí Automated = 5-10 minutes

**Note:** You still manually screen papers (title/abstract/full-text), extract data, and synthesize findings. Automation handles mechanical tasks only.

2. **Complete `search_protocol_template.md`**
   - Fill in research questions
   - Use `inclusion_exclusion_criteria_template.md` to define criteria
   - Develop keyword strategy (Section 4-5)
   - List databases to search (Section 6)
3. **Finalize protocol BEFORE searching** (avoid bias)

### Phase 2: Searching (Week 1-2)

1. **Execute searches in each database**
2. **Document in `search_protocol_template.md` Section 5**
   - Record exact search strings
   - Record dates
   - Record result counts
3. **Export results to reference manager** (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote)
4. **Remove duplicates**
5. **Update `prisma_flow_diagram_template.md`** (Identification section)

### Phase 3: Screening (Week 2-4)

1. **Title/Abstract Screening**
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Use decision tree from `inclusion_exclusion_criteria_template.md`
   - Track excluded papers with reasons
   - Update `prisma_flow_diagram_template.md` (Screening section)

2. **Full-Text Screening**
   - Retrieve full-text articles
   - Apply full criteria
   - Document exclusions in detail
   - Update `prisma_flow_diagram_template.md` (Eligibility section)

3. **Citation Network Analysis**
   - Backward search (check references of key papers)
   - Forward search (check papers citing key papers)
   - Update `prisma_flow_diagram_template.md` (Additional sources)

### Phase 4: Data Extraction (Week 4-6)

1. **Open `synthesis_matrix_template.csv`**
2. **Create one row per included paper**
3. **Extract key information systematically**
4. **Rate quality using criteria from `search_protocol_template.md` Section 9**
5. **Add notes on relevance to each research question**

### Phase 5: Synthesis (Week 6-8)

1. **Analyze `synthesis_matrix_template.csv`**
   - Sort by theme/topic
   - Group similar methodologies
   - Identify patterns
   - Find contradictions
   - Locate gaps

2. **Write Literature Review Chapter**
   - Use [chapter_02_literature_review.md](../../templates/dissertation/chapter_02_literature_review.md) template
   - Organize by themes (not chronologically)
   - Synthesize (don't just summarize)
   - Connect to your research questions
   - Highlight gaps your work addresses

### Phase 6: Reporting (Ongoing)

1. **In Methods Section:**
   - Include PRISMA diagram (from `prisma_flow_diagram_template.md`)
   - Summarize search strategy
   - Reference full protocol in appendix

2. **In Appendix:**
   - Complete search protocol (from `search_protocol_template.md`)
   - Full search strings for each database
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria (from `inclusion_exclusion_criteria_template.md`)
   - List of included studies (optional)
   - List of excluded studies with reasons (optional, if manageable)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Start searching without a protocol
**Why:** Risk of bias - you might unconsciously search for papers confirming your hypothesis
**Fix:** Complete search_protocol_template.md FIRST

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Define criteria after screening
**Why:** Post-hoc criteria are not objective
**Fix:** Finalize inclusion/exclusion criteria before seeing search results

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Only search one database
**Why:** Incomplete coverage, not systematic
**Fix:** Search ‚â•2 databases + citation networks

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Forget to document excluded papers
**Why:** PRISMA requires counts and reasons
**Fix:** Track exclusions in prisma_flow_diagram_template.md

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Only cite papers that agree with you
**Why:** Confirmation bias, cherry-picking
**Fix:** Include contradictory findings, discuss disagreements

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Write descriptive summaries
**Why:** Literature review should synthesize and analyze
**Fix:** Organize by themes, identify patterns, critique methods

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Skip quality assessment
**Why:** Low-quality papers can mislead
**Fix:** Rate quality in synthesis matrix, consider excluding very low quality

### ‚ùå **Don't:** Ignore negative results
**Why:** Publication bias - field may overestimate effect sizes
**Fix:** Actively search for failed replications and null results

## Integration with PhD Pipeline

These tools integrate with:

1. **[workflows/02_literature_review.md](../../workflows/02_literature_review.md)**
   - Follow that workflow for step-by-step prompts
   - Use these templates to capture outputs

2. **[templates/dissertation/chapter_02_literature_review.md](../../templates/dissertation/chapter_02_literature_review.md)**
   - Write your synthesis here
   - Reference data from synthesis matrix

3. **[tools/bibliography/](../bibliography/)**
   - Use citation_guidelines.md for citing papers
   - Export references.bib from reference manager

4. **[tools/quality_assurance/scientific_validity_checklist.md](../quality_assurance/scientific_validity_checklist.md)**
   - Verify all literature review claims are cited
   - Ensure RULE 1 compliance (no unsupported claims)

---

## RULE 1: Scientific Truth Compliance

**‚úÖ These tools enforce RULE 1 by:**

1. **Reproducibility:** Systematic search protocol ensures another researcher can replicate your review
2. **Transparency:** PRISMA diagram shows exactly what papers were included/excluded and why
3. **Objectivity:** Predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria minimize bias
4. **Traceability:** Synthesis matrix links every claim to specific papers
5. **Completeness:** Cannot cherry-pick papers - must report all papers meeting criteria

**‚úÖ When writing literature review, you CAN claim:**
- "Our systematic search identified N papers meeting inclusion criteria"
- "X papers reported positive effects, Y papers found null results"
- "The literature shows inconsistent findings (cite, cite, cite)"

**‚ùå When writing literature review, you CANNOT claim:**
- "Most studies agree..." (without systematic count)
- "It is well known..." (without citation)
- "Obviously..." or "Clearly..." (without evidence)
- Selectively cite only papers supporting your hypothesis
