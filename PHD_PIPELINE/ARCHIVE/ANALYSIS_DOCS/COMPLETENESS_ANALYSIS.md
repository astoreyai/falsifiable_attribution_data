### Chapter 6: Results ‚úÖ **85% COMPLETE**

**File Size:** 4.7 KB
**Sections:** 8 main sections
**Word Count Target:** 10,000-15,000 words

#### What's Complete:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive structure
- ‚úÖ Experimental setup guidance (6.2.1)
- ‚úÖ Results presentation templates (tables/figures)
- ‚úÖ Ablation study structure (6.5)
- ‚úÖ Computational performance section (6.6)
- ‚úÖ Qualitative analysis (6.7) with success/failure cases
- ‚úÖ Writing guidelines (objectivity, statistical rigor)
- ‚úÖ Figure/table quality guidelines

#### What's Missing:
- ‚ùå No guidance on statistical significance testing
- ‚ùå No guidance on effect size reporting
- ‚ùå No guidance on handling outliers
- ‚ùå No guidance on negative results
- ‚ùå Missing cross-validation reporting guidance

#### Enhancement Needed:

1. Add statistical testing guidance:
```markdown
## 6.X Statistical Significance Testing

### When to Test:
Test significance when comparing:
- Your method vs. baselines
- Ablation variants
- Different datasets

### How to Report:

**For Continuous Metrics:**
- **t-test** (2 groups): Report t-statistic, p-value, effect size (Cohen's d)
- **ANOVA** (3+ groups): Report F-statistic, p-value, post-hoc tests

**Example:**
> Our method achieves 92.3% accuracy (SD=1.2%) compared to Baseline A's 88.7% (SD=1.5%). This difference is statistically significant (t(48)=5.23, p<0.001, Cohen's d=2.47), indicating a large effect size.

**For Count Data:**
- **Chi-square test:** Report œá¬≤, df, p-value

**Reporting Template:**
- Metric: Mean ¬± SD
- Statistical test: [Name]
- Test statistic: [Value]
- p-value: [<0.001 / 0.023 / 0.156]
- Effect size: [Cohen's d / Œ∑¬≤ / etc.]
- Conclusion: [Significant/Not significant] at Œ±=0.05

### Multiple Comparison Correction:
When running k tests, adjust Œ±:
- **Bonferroni:** Œ±_adj = 0.05 / k
- **FDR:** Use Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
- **Report:** "We applied Bonferroni correction for k=[number] comparisons"
```

2. Add effect size guidance:
```markdown
## Effect Sizes

Always report effect sizes, not just p-values!

**Cohen's d (for t-tests):**
- Small: d = 0.2
- Medium: d = 0.5
- Large: d = 0.8

**Œ∑¬≤ (for ANOVA):**
- Small: Œ∑¬≤ = 0.01
- Medium: Œ∑¬≤ = 0.06
- Large: Œ∑¬≤ = 0.14

**Formula:**
Cohen's d = (M‚ÇÅ - M‚ÇÇ) / SD_pooled
```

3. Add negative results guidance:
```markdown
## Reporting Negative Results

**Be honest about what didn't work:**

### Hypothesis Not Supported:
> We hypothesized that [X] would improve performance. However, experiments showed no significant difference (p=0.42), suggesting [interpretation].

### Method Limitations:
> Our approach performs well on [Dataset A] but poorly on [Dataset B] (accuracy: 65% vs. 92%). Analysis reveals this is due to [reason], indicating a limitation when [condition].

**Why this is important:**
- Scientific integrity (RULE 1)
- Helps future researchers avoid same issues
- Shows you tested your assumptions
```

4. Add cross-validation reporting:
```markdown
## Reporting Cross-Validation

**If using k-fold cross-validation:**

**Table 6.X: Cross-Validation Results**
| Fold | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| 1 | 91.2% | 89.5% | 92.1% | 90.8% |
| 2 | 90.8% | 88.9% | 91.5% | 90.2% |
| 3 | 92.1% | 90.2% | 93.0% | 91.6% |
| 4 | 91.5% | 89.8% | 92.5% | 91.1% |
| 5 | 91.0% | 89.1% | 91.8% | 90.4% |
| **Mean** | **91.3%** | **89.5%** | **92.2%** | **90.8%** |
| **SD** | **0.5%** | **0.5%** | **0.6%** | **0.5%** |

Report: "We performed 5-fold cross-validation with mean accuracy of 91.3% (SD=0.5%)."
```

#### Completeness Rating: **85%** (excellent, needs statistical testing guidance)

## PART 2: WORKFLOW ANALYSIS

[Continued in next section due to length...]

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Templates Need:
1. **Chapters 3, 5, 7, 8** urgently need complete rewrites (currently 30-40% complete)
2. **All chapters** need citation reminder boxes
3. **All chapters** need revision iteration guidance
4. **Field-specific adaptations** for non-CS fields

### Workflows Need:
1. **Complete all prompts** (currently only 2 of 6-8 prompts per workflow)
2. **Add iteration loops** (revision cycles)
3. **Add quality gates** (can't proceed until X is complete)

### Missing System Components:
1. **Advisor communication** templates (weekly updates, milestone reports)
2. **Data management** protocols
3. **Defense preparation** materials (presentation templates, Q&A prep)
4. **Peer review** system (how to get feedback)
5. **Time management** tools (Gantt charts, burndown)

---

**RECOMMENDATION:** Pipeline needs 20-30 hours of focused enhancement work to reach 95% completeness.

**NEXT STEPS:** Create detailed enhancement plan in separate document.
