## ORIGINAL PART 2: WORKFLOW FILE ANALYSIS (All gaps now resolved ‚úÖ)

### Workflow 01: Topic Development ‚úÖ **85% COMPLETE**

**File Size:** 7.3 KB
**Sections:** 5 subcomponents, 5 prompts

#### What's Complete:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive 5-stage process
- ‚úÖ All 5 prompts fully written (1.1-1.5)
- ‚úÖ Quality checks
- ‚úÖ Iteration guidance
- ‚úÖ Output file structure
- ‚úÖ Clear deliverables

#### What's Missing:
- ‚ùå No advisor consultation checkpoint (when to involve advisor?)
- ‚ùå No timeline estimation (how long should each prompt take?)
- ‚ùå No examples of good vs. bad research questions
- ‚ùå No troubleshooting guide (what if stuck?)

#### Enhancement Needed:

```markdown
## Advisor Consultation Points

**Before Prompt 1.1:**
- [ ] Discuss general area of interest with advisor
- [ ] Understand advisor's expectations and preferences
- [ ] Clarify resource constraints

**After Prompt 1.3 (Research Questions):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** Get advisor approval of research questions
- [ ] Do not proceed to Stage 2 without approval

**After Prompt 1.5 (Scope Definition):**
- [ ] Review scope with advisor
- [ ] Ensure scope is appropriate for dissertation

---

## Timeline Estimation

| Prompt | Est. Time | Effort Level |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 1.1 Topic Brainstorming | 3-5 days | Medium |
| 1.2 Gap Analysis | 1 week | High (requires reading) |
| 1.3 RQ Formulation | 3-5 days | High (critical step) |
| 1.4 Framework Selection | 3-5 days | Medium |
| 1.5 Scope Definition | 2-3 days | Medium |
| **Total Stage 1** | **3-4 weeks** | |

---

## Examples of Good Research Questions

### ‚ùå **BAD** Research Questions:
1. "Does X work?" (Too vague, yes/no)
2. "How can we improve Y?" (Not specific, no measurable outcome)
3. "What is the best algorithm for Z?" (Impossible to answer definitively)

### ‚úÖ **GOOD** Research Questions:
1. "To what extent does technique X improve metric Y compared to baseline Z?" (Specific, measurable)
2. "What are the key factors influencing the performance of algorithm A on dataset B?" (Exploratory, clear scope)
3. "How does parameter P affect the tradeoff between accuracy and speed in method M?" (Testable, quantifiable)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't narrow down topic
**Solution:**
1. Start with 10 ideas
2. Apply feasibility filter (resources, time)
3. Ask: "Can I get a dataset for this?"
4. Ask: "Has anyone done exactly this?"
5. Narrow to top 3
6. Discuss with advisor

### Problem: Research questions too broad
**Solution:**
Use the "Zoom In" technique:
- Start: "Improve machine learning"
- Zoom 1: "Improve neural network training"
- Zoom 2: "Improve convergence speed of gradient descent"
- Zoom 3: "Adaptive learning rates for deep networks on image tasks"

### Problem: Can't find research gap
**Solution:**
Look for these types of gaps:
1. **Methodological:** "No one has tried [technique] for [problem]"
2. **Contextual:** "Studies exist for [domain A] but not [domain B]"
3. **Temporal:** "Studies are outdated (pre-2015), need replication with modern methods"
4. **Integration:** "Methods A and B exist separately, but combining them is unexplored"
```

#### Completeness Rating: **85%** (excellent, needs minor enhancements)
