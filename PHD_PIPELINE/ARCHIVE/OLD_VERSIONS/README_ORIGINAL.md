## How to Use This Project

### Option 1: Start a New Dissertation (Recommended)

**For ANY PhD topic in ANY field:**

```bash
# 1. Initialize your dissertation
cd PHD_PIPELINE
./automation/scripts/setup.sh MY_DISSERTATION

# 2. Configure your topic
cd MY_DISSERTATION
nano config.yaml

# 3. Follow the workflows in order
# See PHD_PIPELINE/workflows/
```

**Timeline:** 6-15 months depending on research scope

**Deliverables:**
- 8 complete chapters (80,000-100,000 words)
- Professional LaTeX-compiled PDF
- 150-200 references
- Defense-ready dissertation

---

### Option 2: Resume FastSHAP-ViT Project

If you want to continue the archived FastSHAP-ViT dissertation:

```bash
# Copy archived content
cp -r ARCHIVE/FASTSHAP_VIT_DISSERTATION/chapters chapters_working/
cp -r ARCHIVE/FASTSHAP_VIT_DISSERTATION/implementation code_working/

# See ARCHIVE/FASTSHAP_VIT_DISSERTATION/README.md for details
```

**Note:** Would require 6-9 months to complete (needs experiments, expanded chapters)

## Philosophy

This pipeline was built with these principles:

1. **Honest Claims Only** - Never claim what you can't prove
2. **Systematic Execution** - Complete phases in order
3. **Template-Based** - Don't start from scratch
4. **Quality Focus** - Every claim needs evidence
5. **Realistic Timelines** - 6-15 months for completion

---

- **Python 3.8+** (if using code generation/analysis)
- **LaTeX** (for PDF compilation)
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full  # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
- **Git** (for version control)

### Hardware
- Any modern laptop/desktop
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, SSD storage
- Optional: GPU (for computational research)

### Time Commitment
- **Minimal:** 6-8 weeks (using existing research)
- **Typical:** 6-9 months (moderate research)
- **Comprehensive:** 12-15 months (full research execution)
