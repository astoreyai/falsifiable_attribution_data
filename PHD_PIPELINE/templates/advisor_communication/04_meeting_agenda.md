## EXAMPLE: REGULAR BI-WEEKLY MEETING

```
Dear Dr. Smith,

Looking forward to our meeting on Thursday, November 7, 2025 at 2:00 PM (Zoom).

Here's the agenda for our discussion:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 MEETING DETAILS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Date:** Thursday, November 7, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM (30 minutes)
**Location:** Zoom (link below)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 PROGRESS UPDATE (Brief)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Since last meeting (Oct 24):**

✅ Completed Fast Explainer training (Stage 2)
   → Achieved 0.73 insertion AUC (exceeds 0.7 target)
✅ Started joint fine-tuning (Stage 3)
   → 28 of 48 GPU hours complete
✅ Finished all RQ1 latency benchmarks
   → FastSHAP: 42ms, Grad-CAM: 18ms, RISE: 1,200ms, LIME: 890ms

**Current status:** Data analysis 65% complete, on track for August finish

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 AGENDA ITEMS (Priority Order)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**1. FAITHFULNESS RESULTS: INTERPRETATION QUESTION** (Est. 12 min)
   - **Issue:** Insertion AUC is 0.73 (good), but deletion AUC is 0.59 (lower
               than expected). Is this acceptable, or a red flag?

   - **Background:** Deletion AUC measures what happens when we remove important
                     features. Literature suggests deletion should be 0.05-0.10
                     lower than insertion, but mine is 0.14 lower (0.73 - 0.59).

   - **Your current thinking:** This might be due to ArcFace's margin-based loss
                                 (removing features doesn't degrade as expected).
                                 I could:
                                 A) Accept 0.59 and explain in dissertation
                                 B) Tune hyperparameters to improve (adds 1 week)
                                 C) Use different faithfulness metric

   - **What I need:** Your opinion on whether 0.59 is defensible, or if I should
                      invest time to improve it.

**2. FAIRNESS EXPERIMENTS: DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP SELECTION** (Est. 10 min)
   - **Issue:** FairFace has 7 demographic groups, but 3 are underrepresented
               (n < 3,000). Should I report all 7 or focus on 4 main groups?

   - **Background:** RQ3 evaluates demographic fairness. 4 groups (White, Black,
                     Asian, Latino) have n > 5,000 each. 3 groups (Middle Eastern,
                     Indian, Pacific Islander) have n < 3,000.

   - **Your current thinking:** Report all 7 for completeness, but acknowledge
                                 that smaller groups have lower statistical power
                                 (wider confidence intervals).

   - **What I need:** Confirmation this is the right approach, or if I should
                      exclude small groups to avoid weak conclusions.

**3. CHAPTER 6 (RESULTS) STRUCTURE REVIEW** (Est. 5 min)
   - **Issue:** Chapter 6 is getting long (currently 12,500 words). Should I
               split it into two chapters (6A: Accuracy/Latency, 6B: Fairness)?

   - **Background:** Most dissertations have single results chapter, but mine
                     has 3 RQs with extensive results for each.

   - **Your current thinking:** Keep as one chapter, but use clear subheadings
                                 (6.1, 6.2, 6.3 for each RQ).

   - **What I need:** Your preference—one long chapter or split into two?

**4. TIMELINE CHECK** (Est. 3 min)
   - Quick sanity check: Still on track for September 2025 defense?

**Total estimated time:** 30 minutes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📄 MATERIALS FOR REVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

No advance materials—we'll discuss during meeting. I can screen-share results
if helpful.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 NEXT STEPS (Tentative)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**After this meeting:**
- Finalize fairness experiments (RQ3) based on your guidance
- Continue Chapter 6 writing (aiming for draft by Nov 20)
- Start preparing figures for Results chapter

**Next meeting:** Thursday, November 21, 2025, 2:00 PM?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Please let me know if you'd like to adjust the agenda or add anything.

Best regards,
Aaron

## BEST PRACTICES FOR EFFECTIVE MEETINGS

### 1. Prepare the Agenda in Advance
- **24-48 hours before:** Gives advisor time to think
- **Prioritize items:** Most important first (in case you run out of time)
- **Estimate time:** Shows you respect their time

### 2. Come Prepared with Options
**GOOD:** "I've considered 3 approaches: A, B, C. I'm leaning toward B because
          [reasons]. What do you think?"

**BAD:** "What should I do about [problem]?" (puts all burden on advisor)

### 3. Take Notes During Meeting
- Write down decisions and guidance
- Ask clarifying questions if unclear
- Confirm understanding: "Just to confirm, you're suggesting I [action]?"

### 4. Send Follow-Up Notes Within 24 Hours
- Documents decisions
- Ensures alignment
- Creates accountability (for both of you)

### 5. Track Action Items
Keep a running list of action items and report status in next meeting:
```
Action from Oct 24 meeting: "Revise Chapter 3 proofs"
→ Status: DONE (sent you draft on Nov 1)
```

### 6. Be Flexible
If advisor says "let's talk about X instead," adapt. Your agenda is a guide,
not a mandate.

### 7. End with Next Steps
Always clarify:
- What you'll do next
- What advisor will do (if applicable)
- When you'll meet again

---

## COMMON MEETING PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T: Show Up Without Agenda
**Result:** Unfocused meeting, wasted time, advisor frustrated

### ❌ DON'T: Bring Up Major Issues Without Warning
**Bad:** "By the way, I just realized my entire methodology is flawed..."
**Better:** Email in advance: "I have a major methodology concern—can we discuss
            in next meeting? Here's a brief summary: [...]"

### ❌ DON'T: Expect Advisor to Solve Everything
**Bad:** "I don't know what to do—please tell me."
**Better:** "I've tried A and B, both failed. I'm considering C. What do you think?"

### ❌ DON'T: Forget to Follow Up
Not sending meeting notes = decisions get forgotten, confusion arises later
