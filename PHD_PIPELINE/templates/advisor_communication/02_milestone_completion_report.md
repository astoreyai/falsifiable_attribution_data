3. Fairness: demographic variance reduced from 18.3% to 7.2%

**All 3 research questions answered with strong empirical support.**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔄 PROCESS NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What went well:**
- Maintained consistent writing schedule (2 chapters per month)
- All experiments yielded publishable results (no major failures)
- Reference management (Zotero) kept citations organized throughout

**Challenges encountered:**
- Chapter 6 (Results) took longer than expected (4 weeks vs. 3 planned)
  due to extensive visualizations and statistical reporting
- Had to rewrite Discussion section twice to better connect findings
  to literature (final version is stronger)

**Self-assessment:**
- Strongest chapters: 3 (Theory), 6 (Results) - very confident
- Weakest chapter: 7 (Discussion) - may need significant revision
- Overall: Draft is solid and ready for committee review

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
➡️ NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Immediate next milestone:** Committee Draft Distribution
**Target completion date:** November 15, 2025 (after your feedback)

**Required actions:**
1. Await your feedback (targeting October 15-20?)
2. Incorporate your revisions (2-3 weeks)
3. Distribute to committee with 4-6 week review window
4. Schedule defense (targeting late December or early January)

**Awaiting from you:**
- [ ] Full draft review and feedback
- [ ] Approval to distribute to committee (after revisions)
- [ ] Recommended timeline for committee review

**Specific questions:**
1. Should I distribute to full committee simultaneously, or stage it
   (you first, then others)?
2. For Chapter 7 (Discussion), I'm uncertain about the depth of
   "limitations" section—is 2 pages sufficient, or should I expand?
3. Should I include code in appendices, or just link to GitHub?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 TIMELINE UPDATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Overall Progress:** 85% complete
**Original Defense Target:** December 2025
**Updated Defense Target:** Late December 2025 or early January 2026

- Committee distribution: November 15
- Committee review period: 4-6 weeks (Nov 15 - Dec 20)
- Defense scheduling: Late December or early January

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Be Comprehensive but Concise
- Include all key information, but don't write a novel
- Use bullet points and tables for readability
- Attach detailed documents rather than pasting everything in email

### 2. Quantify Everything
- Use specific numbers (word counts, sample sizes, accuracy metrics)
- Show progress with percentages
- Include comparisons to targets/goals

### 3. Provide Context for Timeline Changes
- If behind schedule: explain why and how you'll catch up
- If ahead: explain what enabled faster progress
- Always update expected defense date if it changes

### 4. Request Specific Feedback
- Don't just say "please review"
- Ask specific questions
- Give deadlines (politely): "feedback by [date] would be helpful"

### 5. Acknowledge Challenges Honestly
- Don't hide problems—explain how you addressed them
- Show problem-solving capability
- Ask for guidance if needed
