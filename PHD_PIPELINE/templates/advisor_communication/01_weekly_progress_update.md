## CUSTOMIZATION TIPS

### Adjust Frequency Based on Stage:

**EARLY STAGE (Literature Review, Methodology):**
- Weekly updates recommended
- Focus on: progress through readings, methodology decisions, IRB preparation

**MIDDLE STAGE (Data Collection, Analysis):**
- Weekly updates critical (things move fast)
- Focus on: data quality, analysis results, emerging findings

**LATE STAGE (Writing, Revisions):**
- Weekly updates essential
- Focus on: chapters completed, advisor feedback incorporated, committee readiness

**DEFENSE PREPARATION:**
- Twice-weekly updates (or more)
- Focus on: presentation progress, anticipated questions, logistics

### Be Honest About Challenges

**GOOD:**
> "I'm struggling with the regression analysis - getting unexpected p-values. I've tried X and Y, but results are inconsistent. Could we discuss this in our next meeting?"

**BAD:**
> "Everything is fine!" (when it's not)

### Be Specific with Accomplishments

**GOOD:**
> "✅ Completed Chapter 3 draft (4,500 words)
>    → All 3 research questions now have theoretical grounding
>    → Added 27 citations to support framework"

**BAD:**
> "✅ Worked on Chapter 3"

## EXAMPLE: REAL WEEKLY UPDATE

```
Dear Dr. Smith,

Here's my weekly progress update for May 1-7, 2025:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 THIS WEEK'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Completed E-ViT training (Stage 1)
   → 72 GPU hours completed
   → Achieved 99.2% accuracy on LFW test set (exceeds 99% target)
   → Model checkpoint saved: `checkpoints/evit_arcface_v1.pth`

✅ Started Fast Explainer training (Stage 2)
   → 18 of 48 GPU hours complete
   → Preliminary insertion AUC: 0.68 (target: >0.7)
   → On track to finish by May 10

✅ Generated first 5 result figures
   → Figure 6.1: Training curves
   → Figure 6.2: Accuracy comparison vs. baselines
   → Figure 6.3: Latency benchmarks (preliminary)
   → Figure 6.4: Explanation visualizations (10 examples)
   → Figure 6.5: Ablation study (hierarchical vs. flat SHAP)

📈 KEY METRICS:
- Overall progress: 42% complete (up from 35% last week)
- Experiments completed: 8/30 (RQ1 and RQ2 in progress)
- GPU hours used: 90/200 budgeted hours

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚧 CHALLENGES & BLOCKERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ Insertion AUC slightly below target (0.68 vs. 0.7)
   - Impact: May need additional hyperparameter tuning, adds ~1 week
   - Plan: Will try increasing explainer network depth from 3 to 4 layers
           and adjusting learning rate schedule. If still below 0.7 by
           May 12, I'll reach out for guidance on whether 0.68 is acceptable.

⚠️ FairFace dataset download slower than expected
   - Impact: RQ3 experiments delayed by ~3 days
   - Plan: Using university's high-speed network, should complete download
           by May 9. No impact on overall timeline.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

□ Finish Fast Explainer training (Stage 2) by May 10
□ Start joint fine-tuning (Stage 3) by May 11
□ Complete all RQ1 latency benchmarks (vs. Grad-CAM, RISE, LIME)
□ Download and preprocess FairFace dataset
□ Begin writing Results chapter (Section 6.1: Overview)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❓ QUESTIONS / FEEDBACK NEEDED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. If insertion AUC stabilizes at 0.68 (vs. target 0.7), is this acceptable
   for the dissertation, or should I invest more time to reach 0.7? The
   difference is small, but I want to ensure rigor.

2. For fairness experiments (RQ3), should I report results for all 7
   FairFace demographic groups, or focus on the 3-4 most represented?
   Some groups have only ~3,000 examples.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 TIMELINE STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Overall Progress: 42% complete
Current Stage: Data Analysis (RQ1-RQ2 experiments in progress)
On Track: YES (minor insertion AUC concern, but manageable)

Expected defense date: September 2025 (no change)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Best regards,
Aaron

Next scheduled meeting: Thursday, May 9, 2025 at 2:00 PM

## ADVISOR RESPONSE EXPECTATIONS

**If you don't hear back within 3-4 days:**
- Send a polite follow-up: "Just checking if you had a chance to review my update from [date]. No rush—just want to make sure it didn't get lost in your inbox!"

**If advisor consistently doesn't respond to updates:**
- Bring it up in next meeting: "I've been sending weekly updates—let me know if you'd prefer a different format or frequency."

---

## SAVE LOCATION
