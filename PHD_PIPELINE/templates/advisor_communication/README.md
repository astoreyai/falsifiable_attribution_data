## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Inconsistent Communication
**Problem:** Send weekly updates for 3 weeks, then disappear for 2 months

**Solution:** Set recurring calendar reminder for weekly updates

**Tip:** Even if you have "nothing to report," send a brief update saying so

---

### Mistake 2: Vague Progress Reports
**Problem:** "Worked on dissertation this week"

**Solution:** Be specific with measurable outcomes

**Example:**
- ❌ "Worked on dissertation this week"
- ✅ "Completed Chapter 3 draft (4,500 words), added 27 citations, finalized 3 proofs"

---

### Mistake 3: Only Reporting Good News
**Problem:** Hide challenges, only share successes

**Solution:** Be honest about blockers and ask for help

**Tip:** Advisors appreciate honesty—they can't help if they don't know you're stuck

---

### Mistake 4: No Meeting Agendas
**Problem:** Show up to meetings without structure, waste time

**Solution:** Always send agenda 24-48 hours in advance

**Tip:** Even for "quick check-ins," send a 1-paragraph agenda

---

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Committee Until Defense
**Problem:** No communication with committee for 3 years, then sudden draft dump

**Solution:** Send 2-3 progress updates during dissertation

**Tip:** Committee members appreciate being kept in the loop

---

### Mistake 6: Short Notice for Major Requests
**Problem:** "Can you review my 300-page draft by next week?"

**Solution:** Give adequate time (6-8 weeks for full draft)

**Tip:** Plan backward from defense date to determine draft distribution date

---

### Mistake 7: No Follow-Up After Meetings
**Problem:** Decisions made in meeting, but no written record

**Solution:** Send meeting notes within 24 hours (see Template 04, Post-Meeting Follow-Up)

**Tip:** This creates accountability and prevents misunderstandings

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Build Advisor Relationship Early
- Consistent communication builds trust
- Advisors appreciate proactive students
- Regular updates prevent surprises

### Document Everything
- Save all emails (yours and advisor's responses)
- Keep records of decisions and guidance
- Useful for resolving disagreements, tracking progress, writing CV

### Adapt Templates to Your Style
- These templates are starting points
- Adjust tone/format to match your advisor's preferences
- Some advisors prefer brief updates, others want detail

### Ask Advisor About Preferences
In early meeting, ask:
- "How often would you like progress updates?"
- "Do you prefer email updates or just meeting discussions?"
- "What format works best for you?"

### Balance Frequency
- **Too little:** Advisor loses track of your progress, may forget about you
- **Too much:** Advisor feels overwhelmed, may start ignoring emails
- **Sweet spot:** Weekly updates + meeting agendas + milestone reports

---

## 🎓 FINAL THOUGHTS

**Effective communication is not just about staying in touch—it's about:**
- Demonstrating professionalism
- Building accountability
- Maximizing advisor's guidance
- Creating documentation for your career
- Reducing stress (for both you and advisor)

**Remember:** Your advisor wants you to succeed. Clear, consistent communication makes their job easier and increases your chances of a successful, timely defense.
