## SPECIFIC SCENARIO TEMPLATES

### Scenario 1: CHAPTER DRAFT FEEDBACK

```
Dear Dr. Smith,

I'm requesting feedback on: **Chapter 3 (Theoretical Foundation) - First Draft**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📄 WHAT I'M REQUESTING FEEDBACK ON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Document:** Chapter 3 - Theoretical Foundation (First Complete Draft)
**Location:** Attached (Chapter_03_Draft1.docx)
**Version:** Draft 1
**Length:** 8,720 words (32 pages)

**Structure:**
- Section 3.1: Background on SHAP values (4 pages)
- Section 3.2: Challenges with biometric systems (6 pages)
- Section 3.3: Novel SHAP formulation for hypersphere embeddings (12 pages)
- Section 3.4: Theoretical guarantees (8 pages)
- Section 3.5: Summary (2 pages)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 SPECIFIC QUESTIONS / FOCUS AREAS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I'm particularly looking for feedback on:

1. **Section 3.3 (Novel SHAP formulation) - Mathematical rigor**
   - Context: This is the core theoretical contribution
   - Current approach: I prove all 4 Shapley axioms hold for hypersphere spaces
   - Concern: Are the proofs sufficiently rigorous for a PhD dissertation?
              Do I need more formal notation or additional lemmas?

2. **Section 3.2 (Challenges) - Motivation strength**
   - Context: This section motivates why existing SHAP doesn't work for ArcFace
   - Current approach: I explain geometric differences between Euclidean and
                       hypersphere spaces
   - Concern: Is the motivation compelling enough? Should I add empirical
              evidence of SHAP failures on ArcFace embeddings?

3. **Overall flow from Section 3.1 → 3.5**
   - Context: Want to ensure logical progression
   - Current approach: Background → Problem → Solution → Guarantees
   - Concern: Does the narrative flow smoothly, or are there gaps?

4. **Citations in Section 3.1**
   - Context: Background on SHAP and Shapley values
   - Current approach: Cited Lundberg & Lee (2017), Shapley (1953), and 5 others
   - Concern: Am I missing key citations? Should I include more recent SHAP
              extensions (e.g., TreeSHAP, KernelSHAP)?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 TIMELINE & URGENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Urgency:** Medium

**Reason for timeline:**
I'd like to incorporate feedback and finalize Chapter 3 before moving to
Chapter 5 (Implementation), which depends on the theoretical foundations
established here.

**Ideal feedback date:** October 20, 2025 (2 weeks)
**Hard deadline:** October 30, 2025 (need to maintain dissertation timeline)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What this is:** First complete draft of Chapter 3 (one of the 4 core chapters
                  for proposal defense)

**Current status:** All sections written, equations formatted in LaTeX, figures
                    included (5 total)

**Previous feedback addressed:**
- Incorporated your August 25 comments on making proofs more accessible
  (added intuitive explanations before formal proofs)
- Expanded Section 3.2 based on your suggestion to strengthen motivation

**Changes since proposal version:**
- Added Section 3.4 (Theoretical Guarantees) - completely new
- Rewrote proofs in Section 3.3 to be more rigorous
- Added 12 new citations (recent SHAP literature from 2023-2024)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ SELF-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Strengths:**
- Section 3.3 (novel formulation) is solid—confident in the math
- Figures clearly illustrate geometric differences
- Proofs are complete and (I believe) correct

**Weaknesses:**
- Section 3.1 (background) may be too long—could condense from 4 to 3 pages
- Section 3.2 (motivation) feels weak—might need empirical evidence
- Notation is inconsistent in places (switching between bold and non-bold vectors)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Preferred feedback format:**
- [x] Track changes in Word (attached as .docx)
- [ ] Meeting to discuss major issues (if needed)

I'm happy to schedule a meeting to discuss any major concerns. Otherwise,
written feedback would be perfect.

Best regards,
Aaron

### Scenario 2: METHODOLOGY DECISION FEEDBACK

```
Dear Dr. Smith,

I'm requesting feedback on: **Sampling Strategy Decision (Methodology)**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📄 WHAT I'M REQUESTING FEEDBACK ON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Decision:** Whether to use stratified random sampling OR purposive sampling
              for my participant recruitment

**Context:** I need to finalize my sampling strategy before submitting IRB
             application next week

**Document:** Brief 2-page comparison (attached)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**THE DECISION:**

**Option A: Stratified Random Sampling**
- Randomly sample 250 participants from professional network database
- Stratify by: role (30% executives, 40% managers, 30% analysts)
- PROS: Generalizable, statistically rigorous, easier to justify
- CONS: May miss "information-rich" cases, less flexible

**Option B: Purposive Sampling**
- Purposively select 30 participants who are "expert users" of AI systems
- Criteria: 5+ years experience, use AI tools daily, decision-making roles
- PROS: Captures rich insights, aligns with qualitative approach
- CONS: Not generalizable, harder to justify sample size, risk of bias

**MY CURRENT THINKING:**
I'm leaning toward **Option A (stratified random)** because:
1. My research questions are primarily quantitative (testing hypotheses)
2. I want to generalize findings to broader population
3. Committee may prefer rigorous sampling for PhD-level work

**BUT:** I'm concerned Option A may miss important "expert" perspectives that
         would be valuable for understanding AI adoption challenges.

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**
1. Given my research questions (testing hypotheses about AI adoption barriers),
   which sampling approach is more appropriate?
2. Could I combine both? (e.g., stratified random for n=250 + purposive for
   n=10 expert interviews as a "mixed methods" add-on?)
3. Will committee accept purposive sampling for a quantitative study?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 TIMELINE & URGENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Urgency:** HIGH

**Reason:**
- IRB application due: November 1, 2025 (8 days)
- Sampling strategy is required in IRB protocol
- Need your input to finalize Chapter 4 (Methodology) section 4.3

**Ideal feedback date:** October 27, 2025 (3 days)
**Hard deadline:** October 30, 2025 (need 1 day to finalize IRB)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Research questions (brief reminder):**
- RQ1: What barriers prevent AI adoption in healthcare organizations?
- RQ2: How do organizational factors moderate adoption success?
- RQ3: What strategies overcome adoption barriers?

**Research design:** Explanatory sequential mixed methods
- Phase 1: Quantitative survey (this sampling decision)
- Phase 2: Qualitative follow-up interviews

**Population:** Healthcare administrators and clinicians in US hospitals
                (N ≈ 50,000 accessible through professional network)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I've attached a 2-page comparison document with more details. Happy to discuss
by phone/Zoom if that's easier than email.

Best regards,
Aaron

### Scenario 3: CONFERENCE PAPER FEEDBACK (TIME-SENSITIVE)

```
Subject: URGENT: Conference Paper Feedback - Due Oct 28

Dear Dr. Smith,

I'm requesting feedback on: **Conference Paper for NeurIPS 2025 Submission**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📄 WHAT I'M REQUESTING FEEDBACK ON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Document:** NeurIPS 2025 paper submission (draft)
**Title:** "FastSHAP-ViT: Real-Time Explainable Vision Transformers"
**Location:** Attached (neurips2025_draft2.pdf)
**Version:** Draft 2 (incorporated feedback from lab group)
**Length:** 8 pages + 2 pages appendix (within 10-page limit)

**Conference:** NeurIPS 2025 (top-tier ML conference)
**Submission deadline:** October 28, 2025 (4 days!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 SPECIFIC QUESTIONS / FOCUS AREAS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**PRIORITY 1: Clarity and Impact (Introduction)**
- Does the introduction clearly convey the contribution?
- Is the problem statement compelling for a NeurIPS audience?

**PRIORITY 2: Experimental Rigor (Results section)**
- Are the experiments sufficient to support our claims?
- Reviewers will be critical—any obvious gaps?

**PRIORITY 3: Related Work (Section 2)**
- Did I miss any critical citations?
- Is positioning vs. prior work clear?

**PRIORITY 4: Writing Quality**
- Any awkward phrasing or unclear sentences?
- Conference papers need to be polished

**I'm NOT asking for:**
- Detailed proofreading (I'll do that)
- Formatting fixes (I'll handle NeurIPS template)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 TIMELINE & URGENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Urgency:** VERY HIGH 🔥

**Submission deadline:** October 28, 2025, 11:59 PM PST (4 days)

**Ideal feedback date:** October 26, 2025 (2 days)
**Hard deadline:** October 27, 2025, 5:00 PM (need 1 day for final revisions)

**I understand this is short notice.** I received unexpected lab feedback that
required significant revisions, which delayed getting this to you. If you can
provide feedback on just PRIORITY 1 and 2, that would be incredibly helpful.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What this is:** Conference paper based on Chapter 3 & 6 of my dissertation
                  (novel SHAP formulation + E-ViT architecture)

**Current status:**
- All experiments complete
- Figures finalized (6 figures, 2 tables)
- Incorporated lab feedback from Oct 22 meeting

**Changes since Draft 1:**
- Rewrote introduction based on lab feedback (clearer contribution statement)
- Added ablation study (Table 2)
- Expanded related work to include recent SHAP papers from ICML 2024

**Co-authors:** You (advisor), Dr. Jane Doe (committee member), Aaron (me)
**Your role:** Senior author (will be listed as corresponding author if that works)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ SELF-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Strengths:**
- Strong experimental results (99.2% accuracy, <50ms latency, 0.73 insertion AUC)
- Novel theoretical contribution (SHAP for hypersphere embeddings)
- Well-positioned vs. prior work

**Weaknesses:**
- Introduction may still be unclear (lab gave mixed feedback)
- Related work section is dense (might be too much for 8 pages)
- Some figures could be larger (may sacrifice some text)

**Realistic assessment:** This is borderline accept/reject for NeurIPS. Strong
results, but contribution is somewhat incremental (applying SHAP to new domain
rather than fundamentally new method). I'm hoping clear writing and rigor push
it over the line.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Preferred feedback format:**
- [x] PDF annotations (fastest for you)
- [x] Brief email summary of major issues

I realize this is very short notice and understand if you can't provide
comprehensive feedback. Even high-level comments (e.g., "introduction is
unclear," "add ablation for X") would be immensely helpful.

Thank you for your flexibility!

Best regards,
Aaron

## BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Be Specific About What You Need
**GOOD:** "Does Section 3.3's proof of the symmetry axiom hold? I'm unsure if my assumption on line 12 is justified."

**BAD:** "Please review Chapter 3."

### 2. Give Adequate Time
- **Chapter drafts:** 2-3 weeks
- **Minor decisions:** 3-5 days
- **Conference papers:** 1 week minimum (more if possible)

### 3. Prioritize When Time is Limited
If urgent, tell your advisor:
> "I understand time is tight. If you can only review Sections 3 and 5, that would be most helpful."

### 4. Show You've Done Your Own Review
Include a self-assessment to show you've thought critically about your work.

### 5. Follow Up Appropriately
- **If no response after half the requested time:** Polite reminder
- **If approaching deadline:** More urgent follow-up
- **If past deadline:** Ask if they need more time or if you should proceed

Example follow-up:
```
Dear Dr. Smith,

Following up on my feedback request from [date]. I know you're busy, but the
[deadline/reason] is approaching on [date].

If you haven't had time to review, I understand. Would you prefer I:
1. Proceed with my current approach and we can revise later?
2. Wait for your feedback (I can push [next step] to [new date])?

Please let me know what works best.

Best,
Aaron
```
