- ✅ **IRB Approval Received** (if applicable)
- ✅ **Data Collection Complete**
- ✅ **Major Findings Discovered** (if significant)
- ✅ **Full Draft Ready for Distribution** (critical)
- ✅ **Defense Scheduled** (logistics)
- ✅ **Post-Defense Thank You**

**Frequency:** 3-5 emails total (not weekly)

**Result:** PASS (approved with minor revisions)

**Committee Feedback:**
Your thoughtful questions and feedback during the defense were invaluable. I
particularly appreciated:

  clarify assumptions (Section 3.3)

- Dr. Lee: Your insights on fairness methodology helped me recognize limitations
  in my calibration approach (Section 7.3)

- Dr. Patel: Your suggestions on practical deployment considerations will
  strengthen the Discussion chapter (Section 7.5)

All committee members noted that the research makes solid contributions to the
field and is publication-ready.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📝 MINOR REVISIONS REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Required before final submission:**
1. Clarify assumption in Theorem 3.2 (per Dr. Jones's suggestion)
2. Expand limitations discussion in Section 7.3 (fairness calibration)
3. Add practical deployment considerations to Section 7.5
4. Fix 3 typos identified by committee (list attached)

**Timeline:**
- Revisions due: December 20, 2025 (1 week)
- Dr. Smith (chair) will review and approve
- Final submission to Graduate School: December 23, 2025

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Complete minor revisions (Dec 13-19)
2. Submit revised draft to Dr. Smith for approval (Dec 20)
3. Submit final dissertation to Graduate School (Dec 23)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Thank you again for your time, expertise, and support throughout this journey.
Your guidance has been instrumental in shaping this research and my development
as a scholar.

I'm deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to work with such a distinguished
committee.

Best regards,

## BEST PRACTICES FOR COMMITTEE COMMUNICATION

### 1. Keep it Brief and Infrequent
- **Committee members are busy**—only send updates at major milestones
- **Aim for 3-5 emails total** before defense
- **Use bullet points** and clear structure

### 2. Always CC Your Advisor
- Never email committee members individually without advisor's knowledge
- Advisor (chair) should be primary contact
- Use "To: Advisor, CC: Committee" format

### 3. Be Respectful of Expertise
- Highlight areas relevant to each member's expertise
- Don't ask everyone to review everything in depth
- Give specific focus areas (see Example 2)

### 4. Give Adequate Notice
- **Draft distribution:** 6-8 weeks before defense
- **Defense scheduling:** 8-10 weeks before defense
- **Zoom links:** 2 weeks before defense

### 5. Provide Clear Action Items
- State exactly what you need from committee
- Give specific deadlines
- Make it easy to respond

### 6. Follow University Protocols
- Check your institution's requirements for committee communication
- Some universities have specific timelines (e.g., "draft must be distributed
  minimum 4 weeks before defense")
- Consult your advisor on norms in your department

---

## COMMITTEE COMMUNICATION TIMELINE (TYPICAL)

| Milestone | When | Email Type |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **Proposal Approved** | After approval | Welcome email |
| **Data Collection Complete** | Mid-dissertation | Progress update |
| **Major Findings** | If significant | Optional update |
| **Draft Ready** | 6-8 weeks before defense | **CRITICAL:** Draft distribution |
| **Defense Scheduled** | 2 weeks before | Logistics email |
| **Post-Defense** | Within 24 hours | Thank you email |

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T: Over-Communicate
**Bad:** Weekly updates to entire committee
**Better:** Weekly updates to advisor, milestone updates to committee

### ❌ DON'T: Under-Communicate
**Bad:** No updates for 2 years, then sudden draft distribution
**Better:** 2-3 updates during dissertation + draft distribution

### ❌ DON'T: Request Unrealistic Turnaround
**Bad:** "Can you review my 300-page draft by next week?"
**Better:** "Please review by [date 6 weeks away]"

### ❌ DON'T: Forget to Follow Up
**Bad:** Send draft, never follow up, assume everyone will read it
**Better:** Send draft → polite reminder 2 weeks before defense

### ❌ DON'T: Surprise Committee at Defense
**Bad:** Major changes to dissertation not communicated beforehand
**Better:** All major changes communicated in draft distribution email

defense!
