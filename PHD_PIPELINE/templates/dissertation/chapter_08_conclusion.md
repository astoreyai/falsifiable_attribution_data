## 8.1 Summary of Contributions

This dissertation addressed the problem of real-time, fair, and theoretically-grounded explainability for vision transformers in face recognition. We developed FastSHAP-ViT, a hierarchical Shapley value framework with demographic calibration that achieves <50ms latency, >0.7 faithfulness, and <10% demographic variance. Our work makes the following contributions:

**Finding:**
Hierarchical SHAP with GPU acceleration achieves O(M log M) complexity with faithful explanations, confirming our theoretical predictions.

**Key Result:**
58ms latency per explanation (M=8 features, K=100 samples) with 0.76 insertion AUC, representing a 36× speedup over KernelSHAP (2,100ms) while maintaining comparable faithfulness (KernelSHAP: 0.78 AUC).

E-ViT with E-MHA maintains accuracy (99.2% on LFW) while generating explanations during forward pass, demonstrating that interpretability does not require sacrificing performance.

**Key Result:**
99.2% accuracy (matching baseline ViT's 99.3%) with +12ms latency overhead for explanation generation (46ms → 58ms total).

**Implication:**
Inherently interpretable vision transformers are viable for high-accuracy face recognition, eliminating the need for separate post-hoc explanation methods.

---

### RQ3: Demographic Fairness

**Finding:**
Statistical calibration reduces explanation variance across seven demographic groups from 24% to 8.7%, meeting our <10% fairness target while preserving faithfulness (0.97 rank correlation).

**Key Result:**
63% reduction in variance (uncalibrated: 24%, calibrated: 8.7%) with <1% accuracy degradation (99.2% → 99.1%) and minimal latency cost (+3ms).

**Implication:**
Fair explanations across demographic groups are achievable through post-hoc calibration without retraining models or compromising accuracy.

---

**Overall:**

Our findings demonstrate that the "triple constraint" of real-time performance, faithfulness, and fairness is achievable for vision transformer explainability through hierarchical approximation, architectural integration, and demographic calibration. These results establish a pathway for deploying explainable face recognition systems in regulated domains (e.g., EU AI Act compliance).

**Example:**

```markdown
## 8.3 Impact and Significance

This work has impact across scientific, practical, and societal dimensions:

### Scientific Impact

**Advances in Explainable AI:**

Our work advances XAI for deep learning by bridging game theory (Shapley values) and modern architectures (vision transformers). Specifically:

1. **Theoretical Extension:**
   - **Before our work:** SHAP theory assumed Euclidean feature spaces, limiting applicability to metric learning systems
   - **Our contribution:** Extended SHAP to hypersphere geometries with formal proofs of axiom preservation
   - **Impact:** Enables theoretically-grounded explanations for ArcFace, CosFace, and other metric learning frameworks (widely used in face recognition, person re-identification, image retrieval)

2. **Real-Time Approximation:**
   - **Before our work:** SHAP required exponential computation (O(2^M)), making real-time explainability infeasible
   - **Our contribution:** Hierarchical approximation with O(M log M) complexity and bounded error
   - **Impact:** Makes SHAP viable for interactive systems where <100ms latency is required (recommender systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis)

3. **Fairness in Explanations:**
   - **Before our work:** Fairness research focused on prediction accuracy parity, not explanation equity
   - **Our contribution:** First work to quantify and mitigate demographic bias in feature attributions
   - **Impact:** Establishes new research direction: fairness at the explanation level (not just model level)

**Influence on Related Fields:**

Beyond XAI, our work has implications for:
- **Trustworthy AI:** Demonstrates that transparency (explanations) and fairness can coexist without sacrificing accuracy
- **Interpretable ML:** Shows that inherently interpretable architectures (E-ViT) can match black-box performance
- **Computer Vision:** Provides methodology for analyzing ViT attention patterns and their relationship to predictions

### Practical Impact

**Who Benefits:**

1. **ML Engineers:** Can deploy real-time, fair explanations using open-source implementation (FastSHAP-ViT) without custom development
2. **Product Managers:** Can offer "explain on demand" features in user-facing applications (authentication, access control) with <100ms latency
3. **Compliance Officers:** Can demonstrate EU AI Act Article 13 compliance (right to explanation) with audit logs of fair explanations
4. **End Users:** Receive understandable explanations for face recognition decisions (e.g., "Matched based on eyes and mouth") without demographic bias

**Use Cases Enabled:**

Our work enables the following practical applications:
- **Banking/Finance:** Face recognition for customer authentication with real-time explanations and demographic fairness (GDPR, AI Act compliance)
- **Healthcare:** Patient identity verification with interpretable explanations for audit trails (HIPAA compliance)
- **Access Control:** Physical security systems with explainable decisions (reduces false accepts/rejects via user feedback)
- **Law Enforcement:** Forensic face recognition with documented explanations for court proceedings (Daubert standard for expert testimony)

### Societal Impact

**Broader Implications:**

This work contributes to **trustworthy AI** by addressing three societal concerns:

1. **Transparency:** Provides understandable explanations for high-stakes face recognition decisions, enabling users to challenge incorrect predictions
2. **Fairness:** Reduces demographic bias in explanations (24% → 8.7% variance), ensuring equitable treatment across race, gender, and age groups
3. **Accountability:** Creates audit trail of explanations (logged with predictions), enabling post-hoc review of system behavior

These contributions align with regulatory trends:
- **EU AI Act:** Requires "right to explanation" for high-risk AI systems (biometric identification, credit scoring, hiring)
- **US NIST AI RMF:** Recommends "explainability and interpretability" as core trustworthy AI principles
- **UK AI White Paper:** Emphasizes "transparency and explainability" for AI governance

**Ethical Considerations:**

Our work addresses ethical concerns by reducing explanation bias and improving transparency. However, we acknowledge that:
- Explanations can be misused to manipulate users ("explanation as persuasion" attacks)
- Demographic calibration requires demographic labels, raising privacy concerns
- Fair explanations do not guarantee fair predictions (model bias remains a separate challenge)

Future work should address these ethical challenges, particularly around privacy-preserving calibration and robust explanations against adversarial manipulation.

## 8.4 Limitations Revisited

**Purpose:** Briefly recap main limitations from Chapter 7 (not a full repeat).

**What to Include:**
- 3-5 most important limitations
- How they constrain interpretation of contributions
- Connection to future work (sets up Section 8.5)

**Template:**

```markdown
## 8.4 Limitations Revisited

We acknowledge the following limitations (detailed in Chapter 7):

1. **[Limitation 1]:**
   - **Description:** [Brief summary]
   - **Impact on Contributions:** [How does this limit claims?]
   - **Future Direction:** [How could this be addressed?]

2. **[Limitation 2]:**
   - [...]

3. **[Limitation 3]:**
   - [...]

**Important:**

These limitations do not invalidate our contributions but establish their boundaries. Our findings are strong evidence for [SCOPE OF CLAIMS], though further work is needed to [EXTENSION].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## 8.4 Limitations Revisited

We acknowledge the following limitations (detailed in Chapter 7, Section 7.6):

1. **Dataset Scope:**
   - **Description:** Evaluated on LFW and FairFace (predominantly Western faces), not global face diversity
   - **Impact on Contributions:** Fairness results (8.7% variance) may not generalize to underrepresented demographics (Middle Eastern, Indigenous, Pacific Islander populations)
   - **Future Direction:** Evaluation on geographically diverse datasets (African Face Database, Indian Face Database) would establish broader generalization

2. **Feature Granularity:**
   - **Description:** Used 8 semantic facial regions; results may differ for other granularities (68 landmarks, pixel-level)
   - **Impact on Contributions:** Hierarchical SHAP's effectiveness is tied to structured feature spaces; may not scale to M > 50 unstructured features
   - **Future Direction:** Multi-scale explanations (hierarchical: face → regions → landmarks) could provide richer interpretability

3. **Faithfulness Metrics:**
   - **Description:** Insertion/deletion AUC measures correlation (not causation) between attributions and predictions
   - **Impact on Contributions:** Cannot conclusively claim attributions reflect causal relationships (spurious correlations possible)
   - **Future Direction:** Causal faithfulness metrics (interventional SHAP) could provide stronger evidence

4. **Static Images Only:**
   - **Description:** Evaluated on single-image face recognition, not video-based or temporal scenarios
   - **Impact on Contributions:** Real-time latency (58ms) applies to static images; video may require additional temporal aggregation
   - **Future Direction:** Extension to video with frame-level attributions + temporal importance weights

5. **Demographic Classifier Dependency:**
   - **Description:** Calibration relies on pretrained classifier (92% accuracy); misclassifications introduce bias
   - **Impact on Contributions:** 8% misclassification rate may propagate errors into calibrated explanations
   - **Future Direction:** User-provided demographic labels (with consent) or privacy-preserving calibration (federated learning)

**Important:**

These limitations do not invalidate our contributions but establish their boundaries. Our findings are strong evidence for **real-time, fair explainability within face recognition** (high-quality, frontal faces with 8 semantic features), though further work is needed to establish generalization to **video, diverse populations, and larger feature sets**.

```

**Example:**

```markdown
### 8.5.1 Short-Term Extensions

The following extensions are natural next steps:

1. **Evaluation on Diverse Demographics:**
   - **What:** Replicate fairness evaluation (Section 6.3) on geographically diverse datasets (African Face Database, Indian Face Database)
   - **Why:** Addresses generalization limitation (Section 8.4) - our results may not apply to underrepresented populations
   - **How:** (1) Obtain datasets with IRB approval. (2) Retrain demographic calibrator on new distributions. (3) Measure variance ratio across expanded demographic groups.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Establish whether 8.7% variance generalizes globally or is Western-face-specific. May require region-specific calibration.

2. **Multi-Scale Hierarchical Explanations:**
   - **What:** Extend hierarchical SHAP to multiple granularities (face → 8 regions → 68 landmarks) with user-selectable detail level
   - **Why:** Addresses feature granularity limitation - current approach is fixed at 8 regions
   - **How:** (1) Build three-level hierarchy: coarse (8 regions), medium (20 sub-regions), fine (68 landmarks). (2) Allow users to "drill down" from coarse to fine explanations. (3) Measure latency and faithfulness at each level.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Richer interpretability for expert users (forensic analysts) while maintaining simplicity for laypeople (coarse level only).

3. **Extension to Video-Based Face Recognition:**
   - **What:** Adapt FastSHAP-ViT to video input, providing frame-level + temporal explanations
   - **Why:** Addresses static image limitation - many real-world systems use video (surveillance, access control)
   - **How:** (1) Aggregate frame embeddings temporally (weighted average by confidence). (2) Compute Shapley values per frame + temporal importance weights. (3) Visualize as timeline: "Frames 5-8 (eyes visible) contributed most to match."
   - **Expected Outcome:** Temporal explanations for video face recognition. Expected latency: ~200ms for 10-frame sequence.

4. **Privacy-Preserving Calibration:**
   - **What:** Demographic calibration without explicit demographic labels using federated learning
   - **Why:** Addresses privacy concern - current calibration requires demographic classification (may violate GDPR Article 9)
   - **How:** (1) Train local calibrators on device (user-provided labels or implicit inference). (2) Aggregate calibration statistics via secure aggregation (no individual labels leave device). (3) Distribute global calibrator.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Privacy-preserving fairness with comparable variance reduction (8-10% vs. current 8.7%).

5. **Causal Faithfulness Evaluation:**
   - **What:** Replace insertion/deletion AUC with interventional SHAP (Chen et al. 2023) to measure causal faithfulness
   - **Why:** Addresses faithfulness metric limitation - insertion AUC measures correlation, not causation
   - **How:** (1) Implement interventional SHAP (replaces features with counterfactuals from training distribution). (2) Compare with standard SHAP (insertion AUC). (3) Measure agreement (do both methods rank features similarly?).
   - **Expected Outcome:** Stronger evidence for faithfulness if interventional SHAP agrees with hierarchical SHAP (or identify discrepancies indicating spurious correlations).

```

**Example:**

```markdown
### 8.5.2 Long-Term Directions

We envision the following long-term research directions:

1. **Universal Explainability Framework for Foundation Models:**
   - **Vision:** Extend FastSHAP-ViT to multimodal foundation models (CLIP, GPT-4 Vision, Gemini) where inputs span text, images, and video
   - **Challenges:** (1) Heterogeneous features (text tokens, image patches, audio frames). (2) Massive scale (billions of parameters, millions of tokens). (3) Emergent capabilities (hard to define "features" for abstract reasoning).
   - **Potential Approach:** Hierarchical SHAP over modality-specific feature groups (text → sentences, images → regions, audio → segments) with cross-modal attention as importance prior. Leverage sparse explanations (top-K features only) to scale.
   - **Impact:** Enable explanations for GPT-4 Vision ("Why did you identify this as a cat?" → "Ears (40%), whiskers (30%), eyes (20%)") with <500ms latency, making foundation models trustworthy for regulated domains.

2. **Adaptive Fairness Calibration:**
   - **Vision:** Dynamic calibration that adapts to evolving demographic distributions and emerging biases (e.g., new underrepresented groups, concept drift)
   - **Challenges:** (1) Detecting demographic shift without labeled data. (2) Updating calibrators without forgetting previous groups (catastrophic forgetting). (3) Balancing individual fairness (per-person) vs. group fairness (per-demographic).
   - **Potential Approach:** Online learning with drift detection (monitor explanation variance over time) + continual learning for calibrators (elastic weight consolidation). Combine group calibration (as in our work) with individual calibration (user-specific bias correction based on feedback).
   - **Impact:** Self-correcting fair AI systems that maintain <10% variance as populations evolve, reducing need for manual recalibration.

3. **Explanation-in-the-Loop Learning:**
   - **Vision:** Use explanations as feedback signal for model improvement (e.g., user corrects explanation → model retrains to align with user's reasoning)
   - **Challenges:** (1) Explanation feedback is sparse and noisy (users may not provide corrections). (2) Aligning model internals with user explanations may degrade accuracy. (3) Adversarial users could manipulate models via false feedback.
   - **Potential Approach:** Active learning with explanation elicitation (ask users to correct explanations for hard examples) + differentiable explanation loss (penalize models where Shapley values disagree with user feedback). Robust aggregation to filter adversarial feedback.
   - **Impact:** Human-AI collaborative learning where models become more interpretable over time by aligning with human reasoning. Expected accuracy gain: 2-5% on tail distributions (rare cases where model initially had wrong reasoning).

4. **Regulatory-Compliant XAI Systems:**
   - **Vision:** Develop XAI systems with built-in audit trails, explanation versioning, and regulatory compliance checks (EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA)
   - **Challenges:** (1) Regulations are evolving (hard to predict future requirements). (2) Audit logs grow unbounded (storage/retrieval at scale). (3) Explanation quality metrics (what counts as "adequate explanation"?) are undefined.
   - **Potential Approach:** Modular compliance framework: (1) Explanation logger (immutable audit trail). (2) Fairness monitor (real-time bias detection). (3) Quality checker (faithfulness, stability metrics). (4) Regulatory adapters (pluggable modules for GDPR, AI Act, etc.). Standardize explanation formats (ExplanationML - proposed standard).
   - **Impact:** Turnkey XAI solutions for regulated industries. Reduces compliance burden from months of legal review to automated checks. Enables "explanation as a service" (XaaS) platforms.

5. **Counterfactual + Shapley Hybrid Explanations:**
   - **Vision:** Combine Shapley attributions (feature importance) with counterfactual explanations (how to change decision)
   - **Challenges:** (1) Counterfactuals and Shapley values may disagree (top Shapley features ≠ best features to change). (2) Generating actionable counterfactuals on face images is ethically fraught (e.g., "change skin tone to be recognized"). (3) Computational cost: both methods are expensive.
   - **Potential Approach:** Unified framework where Shapley values guide counterfactual search (focus on high-attribution features). Present dual explanations: "Why was this decision made? (Shapley)" + "How could this decision be changed? (Counterfactual)." For faces: restrict counterfactuals to actionable changes (facial expression, accessories) not immutable attributes (race, gender).
   - **Impact:** Richer explanations combining diagnosis (Shapley) and prescription (counterfactual). Enables recourse in high-stakes decisions (loan rejection → "Increase income by $10K" not "Change race").

1. **[Question 1]:**
   - **Question:** [Precise question]
   - **Why It Matters:** [Significance]
   - **Current State:** [What do we know?]
   - **Barrier:** [Why hasn't it been solved?]

   - [...]

   - [...]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
### 8.5.3 Open Questions

Several fundamental questions remain open:

1. **Do SHAP Values Capture Causal Relationships?**
   - **Question:** Under what conditions do Shapley values reflect causal importance (not just correlation)?
   - **Why It Matters:** If SHAP only captures correlations, explanations may mislead users (attributing importance to spurious features)
   - **Current State:** Our work (and others) evaluate faithfulness via insertion/deletion AUC (correlation-based). Interventional SHAP (Chen et al. 2023) measures causal faithfulness but is computationally expensive (requires sampling from conditional distributions).
   - **Barrier:** Defining "causal importance" requires causal model of system (often unknown for neural networks). Interventional methods require realistic counterfactuals (hard to generate for images).

2. **What Constitutes an "Adequate" Explanation?**
   - **Question:** How much information (how many features, what level of detail) is necessary for an explanation to be useful?
   - **Why It Matters:** Regulations (EU AI Act) require "adequate explanations" but don't define adequacy. Too little information → not useful. Too much → cognitive overload.
   - **Current State:** Our work provides 8 feature attributions (facial regions). Is this adequate? For whom (experts vs. laypeople)? No consensus on metrics for explanation quality beyond faithfulness.
   - **Barrier:** Adequacy is context-dependent (domain, user expertise, decision stakes) and subjective (what users find useful varies). Human studies are expensive and hard to generalize.

3. **Can Explanations Be Both Fair and Personalized?**
   - **Question:** Is it possible to provide personalized explanations (tailored to individual users' needs) while maintaining demographic fairness (no group bias)?
   - **Why It Matters:** Personalization may improve usefulness (explain in terms user understands) but risks reintroducing bias (different explanation styles for different demographics)
   - **Current State:** Our work focuses on group fairness (statistical parity across demographics). Personalization could mean: (1) Adjust explanation detail level. (2) Use user-preferred terminology. (3) Highlight features user cares about. No work has studied fairness implications of personalization.
   - **Barrier:** Tension between treating users equally (fairness) and treating users differently (personalization). May require individual fairness (similar users get similar explanations) not group fairness.

4. **How Should XAI Handle Emergent Capabilities in Foundation Models?**
   - **Question:** Can we explain emergent capabilities (e.g., GPT-4's ability to solve problems it wasn't explicitly trained for) using feature attribution?
   - **Why It Matters:** Foundation models exhibit behaviors beyond training data (in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning). Traditional XAI assumes learned behavior ≈ training signal. Emergent capabilities break this assumption.
   - **Current State:** Our work (and most XAI research) focuses on supervised learning (clear input-output mapping). Emergent capabilities involve multi-step reasoning (hard to attribute to individual inputs). Mechanistic interpretability (circuits, neurons) may be more appropriate than feature attribution.
   - **Barrier:** Feature attribution assumes linear decomposition (each input feature contributes independently). Emergent capabilities involve non-linear interactions (feature combinations, sequential reasoning). SHAP's interaction terms (O(2^M) complexity) are intractable.

5. **Can We Guarantee Robustness of Explanations Against Adversarial Attacks?**
   - **Question:** Can we certify that explanations remain stable under adversarial perturbations (small input changes)?
   - **Why It Matters:** Adversaries could exploit sensitive explanations to manipulate systems (e.g., identify which features to alter to fool model + explanation). Unstable explanations erode trust.
   - **Current State:** Our work (and most XAI methods) do not address adversarial robustness. Recent work shows SHAP is vulnerable to explanation-aware attacks (Slack et al. 2020). Certified robustness exists for predictions (randomized smoothing) but not explanations.
   - **Barrier:** Explanations involve non-linear operations (sampling coalitions, computing attributions). Existing certified robustness techniques (interval bound propagation, Lipschitz constraints) don't directly apply. Approximate certification may be tractable.

## 8.6 Broader Implications

Stepping back, this work has broader implications for explainable AI, trustworthy systems, and the future of human-AI interaction:

### For the Field of Explainable AI

Our work suggests that **game-theoretic foundations (Shapley values) can scale to modern deep learning** through approximation (hierarchical sampling) and architectural integration (E-ViT). This challenges the prevailing assumption that "theoretically-grounded XAI is too expensive for production" and instead supports a **principled approximation paradigm**: maintain theoretical guarantees (axioms) while reducing computational cost via domain-specific priors (attention weights).

**Paradigm Shift:**

This work is part of a larger shift from **post-hoc XAI** (explain after training) to **inherently interpretable models** (explainability by design). E-ViT demonstrates that explanation generation can be integrated into forward pass (architectural change) rather than grafted on afterward (post-hoc method). Future vision transformer architectures should consider interpretability as a first-class design constraint, not an afterthought.

**Methodological Contribution:**

Beyond face recognition, our hierarchical approximation + domain prior methodology applies to any structured explanation space. Future researchers can apply this approach to:
- **Recommender systems:** Hierarchical item categories + collaborative filtering scores as priors
- **NLP:** Syntactic parse trees + attention weights for sentence-level explanations
- **Time series:** Temporal hierarchies (year → month → day) + saliency for anomaly detection

### For Trustworthy AI

Our work contributes to trustworthy AI by addressing **transparency** (Shapley explanations), **fairness** (demographic calibration), and **accountability** (audit trails). However, achieving trustworthy AI requires more than interpretability alone—it demands:
- **Robustness:** Explanations must remain stable under adversarial perturbations (open question, Section 8.5.3)
- **Privacy:** Calibration should not require demographic classification (future work: federated calibration, Section 8.5.1)
- **Human oversight:** Explanations enable oversight but don't replace it (humans must review high-stakes decisions)
- **Value alignment:** Explanations reveal *how* models decide, not *whether* they should decide (governance question, not technical)

**Lesson:** Technical solutions (our work) are necessary but insufficient for trustworthy AI. Governance, regulation, and human oversight are equally critical.

### For Human-AI Interaction

Ultimately, explanations are for humans. Our work shows that **explanation quality has multiple dimensions** (faithfulness, fairness, latency) that must be balanced for effective human-AI interaction. This suggests that effective XAI requires:
- **Context-awareness:** Different users need different explanations (experts → fine-grained, laypeople → coarse-grained). Multi-scale explanations (future work, Section 8.5.1) address this.
- **Actionability:** Explanations should guide users toward recourse (counterfactuals, Section 8.5.2) not just diagnosis (feature importance)
- **Trust calibration:** Overly confident explanations (always attributing high importance) erode trust. Uncertainty-aware explanations (e.g., "65% confidence that eyes are most important") may improve trust.
- **Feedback loops:** Users should be able to correct explanations (explanation-in-the-loop learning, Section 8.5.2), creating human-AI collaboration not just human oversight.

**Implication:** XAI is not a "one-size-fits-all" problem. Future work should move beyond generic faithfulness metrics toward **user-centered evaluation**: Do explanations help users make better decisions? Do users trust explanations appropriately (not under- or over-trust)? Do explanations reduce bias or simply reveal it?

### Philosophical Reflection

This work raises deeper questions about **algorithmic accountability**. If we can explain *how* an AI made a decision (via Shapley values), does that make the AI *accountable* for its decision? We argue: **No, but explanations are a necessary prerequisite for accountability**.

- **Explanations ≠ Justifications:** Shapley values reveal feature importance but don't justify *why* those features *should* be important. A model might correctly explain that it matched faces based on skin tone—but this doesn't justify using skin tone.
- **Accountability requires human judgment:** Explanations make AI systems auditable (humans can review decisions), but humans must judge whether decisions are *appropriate* (ethical, legal, fair). Technical systems can't make normative judgments.
- **Transparency is a means, not an end:** The ultimate goal is not transparent AI (explainability for its own sake) but *trustworthy* AI that serves human values. Transparency enables oversight, but oversight must be exercised by humans with domain expertise and ethical judgment.

**Conclusion:** Our work provides tools for transparency (real-time, fair explanations). Society must decide how to wield these tools—what decisions should be automated, what level of explanation is adequate, and who holds AI systems accountable when things go wrong. These are governance questions, not technical ones.

```markdown
## 8.7 Closing Remarks

This dissertation began with the problem of real-time, fair, and theoretically-grounded explainability for vision transformers in face recognition—a problem at the intersection of game theory, deep learning, and AI fairness. Through hierarchical Shapley value approximation and demographic calibration, we developed FastSHAP-ViT, a framework that achieves <50ms latency, >0.7 faithfulness, and <10% demographic variance, demonstrating that the "triple constraint" is achievable.

The path was not straightforward. Extending Shapley theory to hypersphere embeddings required rethinking geometric foundations (geodesic distances, not Euclidean). Achieving real-time performance demanded algorithmic innovation (hierarchical approximation), domain-specific priors (attention-guided sampling), and systems optimization (GPU batching, JIT compilation). Addressing fairness required recognizing that demographic bias exists not just in predictions but also in explanations—a problem the XAI community had largely overlooked.

**What This Work Taught Us:**

This work taught us that **principled approximation is possible**: we can maintain theoretical guarantees (Shapley axioms) while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude (O(2^M) → O(M log M)) through structured sampling and domain knowledge. The key insight is that approximation is not about sacrificing rigor—it's about exploiting structure. Hierarchical organization + attention priors enable efficient approximation because face recognition has inherent structure (spatial regions, attention patterns). Future XAI methods should similarly exploit domain structure rather than treating all features as equally important.

**Vision for the Future:**

Looking forward, we envision a future where **explainability is not a separate feature but an intrinsic property of AI systems**. Just as modern compilers produce both efficient code and debugging symbols, future AI systems should produce both accurate predictions and faithful explanations—simultaneously, not as an afterthought. E-ViT is a step toward this vision: explanations generated during forward pass, not post-hoc.

We believe that explainable AI will become the standard for high-stakes applications (healthcare, finance, criminal justice) within the next decade, driven by regulation (EU AI Act, US executive orders) and user demand. But achieving this vision requires:
- **Research:** Extending XAI to multimodal foundation models (GPT-4 Vision, Gemini)
- **Engineering:** Productionizing XAI tools (open-source libraries, cloud services)
- **Governance:** Defining "adequate explanation" and accountability standards
- **Education:** Training practitioners to interpret and use explanations responsibly

**Final Thought:**

As AI systems grow more capable, the need for interpretability grows proportionally. A system that can recognize faces with 99%+ accuracy but cannot explain its decisions is not merely incomplete—it is unaccountable. This dissertation demonstrates that we need not choose between performance and interpretability. With principled approximation, architectural integration, and fairness-aware design, we can build AI systems that are both powerful and transparent.

The question is no longer "*Can* we explain AI?" but "*How well* can we explain it, and *how quickly*?" This work provides one answer: real-time, fair, and theoretically-grounded. The challenge for the community is to build on this foundation, extending explainability from vision transformers to the full breadth of modern AI—from language models to reinforcement learning, from robotics to scientific discovery. The tools are within reach. The imperative is clear. The future of trustworthy AI depends on our collective commitment to transparency, fairness, and accountability.
