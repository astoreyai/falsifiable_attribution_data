## AI WRITING TELLTALE SIGNS TO AVOID

### ❌ AVOID These AI Patterns

1. **Over-formality and rigidity**
   - "It is important to note that..."
   - "It should be noted that..."
   - "Furthermore, it is worth mentioning..."
   - "Additionally, it must be emphasized..."

2. **Repetitive sentence structures**
   - Every sentence starting the same way
   - Consistent use of passive voice throughout
   - Formulaic transitions ("Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally" in sequence)

3. **Excessive hedging**
   - "It is possible that this approach may potentially..."
   - Multiple qualifiers in one sentence
   - Over-use of "might," "could," "potentially," "possibly"

4. **Perfect parallelism**
   - Lists that are too perfectly balanced
   - Every paragraph having exactly the same structure
   - Bullet points with identical grammatical structure

5. **Generic academic filler**
   - "In the context of..."
   - "With respect to..."
   - "In terms of..."
   - "From the perspective of..."

6. **Lack of researcher voice**
   - Never using "we" or "our"
   - Complete absence of subjective assessment
   - No acknowledgment of challenges or surprises

7. **Overly perfect citations**
   - Citations always at the end of sentences
   - Never integrated into sentence flow
   - Alphabetical or chronological citation clusters

8. **Unnaturally smooth transitions**
   - No rough edges
   - Perfect logical flow without gaps
   - No forward references that feel conversational

## ✅ HUMANIZE WITH THESE TECHNIQUES

### 1. Vary Sentence Length and Structure

**Bad (AI-like):**
> The method processes images. The algorithm computes features. The system generates attributions. The results are validated.

**Good (Human-like):**
> The method processes images and computes relevant features. From these, the algorithm generates attributions—which we then validate against ground truth through our counterfactual protocol.

**Technique:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer, clause-heavy ones. Occasional fragments. Real rhythm.

---

### 2. Use Natural Academic Voice ("We")

**Bad (AI-like):**
> The falsifiability criterion is defined. Three conditions are specified. The theorem is proven.

**Good (Human-like):**
> We define our falsifiability criterion through three conditions (detailed in Section 3.2). The proof, while technical, follows directly from the geometric properties of the unit hypersphere.

**Technique:** Use "we" for researcher actions, passive for established facts

---

### 3. Integrate Citations Naturally

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Attribution methods have been studied extensively [1][2][3][4][5]. Several approaches exist [6][7][8].

**Good (Human-like):**
> Grad-CAM [1] and its variants have dominated visual explanation research, though Integrated Gradients [2] offers stronger theoretical guarantees. SHAP [3] generalizes these approaches through game theory, but at substantial computational cost—a point echoed in recent surveys [4,5].

**Technique:** Citations as part of sentence flow, not appended lists

---

### 4. Show Real Research Process

**Bad (AI-like):**
> The experiments were conducted. The results were analyzed. The findings were significant.

**Good (Human-like):**
> Our initial experiments on 100 pairs revealed an unexpected pattern: Grad-CAM's correlation varied wildly (ρ = 0.3–0.9) depending on embedding magnitude. This led us to add the LPIPS plausibility gate, after which results stabilized (Section 5.2).

**Technique:** Acknowledge pivots, surprises, iterative refinement

---

### 5. Use Imperfect Parallelism

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Our contributions are threefold: (1) We define a criterion, (2) We prove existence, (3) We validate empirically.

**Good (Human-like):**
> This work makes three contributions. First, we define the first falsifiable criterion for attribution methods based on counterfactual score prediction. Second, we prove that valid counterfactuals exist on the unit hypersphere (Theorem 2). Finally, experiments on LFW demonstrate that Grad-CAM and IG pass this test while SHAP does not.

**Technique:** Vary list item structure; not all parallel

---

### 6. Strategic Hedging (Not Excessive)

**Bad (AI-like):**
> This approach could potentially possibly maybe improve results in some contexts.

**Good (Human-like):**
> We expect this approach to generalize to other ArcFace-style models, though further validation on CosFace and AdaFace is needed.

**Technique:** One hedge per claim, tied to specific scope limitation

---

### 7. Conversational Asides (Sparingly)

**Bad (AI-like):**
> The algorithm terminates in O(KT) iterations.

**Good (Human-like):**
> The algorithm terminates in O(KT) iterations—typically around 50–100 in practice, well within interactive latency budgets.

**Technique:** Dashes for asides, occasional parenthetical remarks with practical context

---

### 8. Acknowledge Limitations Honestly

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Future work will extend this to all domains.

**Good (Human-like):**
> Our evaluation covers only ArcFace models on LFW/CelebA. Whether these findings transfer to other architectures (FaceNet, DeepFace) or datasets with better demographic balance remains an open question—one we plan to address through collaboration with forensic practitioners.

**Technique:** Specific limitations, credible future work, acknowledge help needed

---

### 9. Vary Transition Style

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Furthermore, the method scales well. Moreover, it is efficient. Additionally, it is accurate.

**Good (Human-like):**
> The method scales well. Efficiency is also strong (Section 4.3). Accuracy, surprisingly, exceeds our initial expectations.

**Technique:** Drop explicit transitions sometimes; use adverbs; vary placement

---

### 10. Show Domain Expertise

**Bad (AI-like):**
> Face verification is important. Many applications exist.

**Good (Human-like):**
> Face verification underpins everything from border control to financial authentication. Yet recent wrongful arrests (Williams 2020, Parks 2021) expose a gap: these systems deploy XAI methods without validation. Explanations are generated but never tested.

**Technique:** Specific examples, real incidents, practitioner perspective

---

## JOURNAL-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS

### IJCV / IEEE TPAMI (Article A)
**Style:** Formal but direct
**Voice:** "We" acceptable for novel contributions
**Tone:** Confident but measured
**Citations:** Integrated into text, not clustered
**Structure:** Theorem-proof rigor, but with motivation
**Length:** Dense content, every sentence earns its place

**Example Opening:**
> Explainable AI for face verification faces a credibility crisis. Despite widespread deployment—from border control to financial authentication—no verification method offers scientific testability. Explanations are generated, but never validated. We address this gap through the first falsifiable criterion for attribution methods: counterfactual score prediction on the unit hypersphere.

---

### IEEE T-IFS (Article B)
**Style:** Practitioner-focused, technical but accessible
**Voice:** "We" for method, passive for procedures
**Tone:** Prescriptive (protocol), balanced (evaluation)
**Citations:** Frequent to standards (Daubert, ISO, NIST)
**Structure:** Step-by-step, reproducible, operational
**Length:** Detailed procedures, checklists, templates

**Example Opening:**
> Forensic face verification demands more than saliency maps. Under Daubert and the EU AI Act, explanations must be testable, with documented error rates and controlling standards. Yet no such protocol exists. We present a pre-registered validation framework with frozen acceptance thresholds (ρ > 0.7, CI coverage 90–100%) and a forensic reporting template aligned to evidentiary requirements.

---

### AI & Law (Article C)
**Style:** Interdisciplinary, accessible to legal audience
**Voice:** "We" sparingly, focus on implications
**Tone:** Analytical, policy-oriented, actionable
**Citations:** Legal precedents, statutes, policy docs
**Structure:** Requirement → Gap → Solution
**Length:** Concise, table-driven, practitioner-ready

**Example Opening:**
> The EU AI Act demands "meaningful information" from high-risk systems (Art. 13). GDPR grants a right to explanation (Art. 22). Daubert requires testability. Yet current XAI practice—generate saliency map, deploy—meets none of these. This article operationalizes seven legal requirements into measurable validation criteria, providing the first compliance roadmap for face verification explanations.

## SPECIFIC REWRITING TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Break Up Perfect Lists

**Before (AI-like):**
```
Our method has three properties:
1. It is fast (O(KT) complexity)
2. It is accurate (ρ > 0.7 correlation)
3. It is robust (95% CI coverage)
```

**After (Human-like):**
```
The method satisfies three desiderata. First, computational efficiency: O(KT) complexity yields ~4 sec per image on consumer GPUs. Second, predictive accuracy, with correlation consistently above ρ = 0.7. Robustness, measured through CI coverage, meets the 95% standard.
```

---

### Technique 2: Weave in Citations

**Before (AI-like):**
> Several attribution methods exist. Grad-CAM is popular [1]. Integrated Gradients is principled [2]. SHAP is general [3].

**After (Human-like):**
> Grad-CAM [1] dominates visual explanation research due to its speed and class-discriminative localization. For applications requiring axiomatic guarantees, Integrated Gradients [2] offers path-integral faithfulness. SHAP [3] generalizes both through game-theoretic feature attribution—though at 100× higher computational cost.

---

### Technique 3: Acknowledge Messiness

**Before (AI-like):**
> The experiments validated our hypothesis.

**After (Human-like):**
> The experiments largely validated our hypothesis. Grad-CAM and IG passed (ρ = 0.82 and 0.89), but SHAP's correlation (ρ = 0.51) fell below our pre-registered threshold. Interestingly, SHAP's failure occurred specifically on high-frequency features (glasses, beards)—suggesting the issue is superpixel granularity, not the falsifiability criterion itself.

---

### Technique 4: Show Iteration

**Before (AI-like):**
> We set the threshold to 0.7.

**After (Human-like):**
> We initially considered ρ > 0.5 (moderate effect, Cohen 1988) but pilot experiments showed this was too permissive—SHAP passed despite poor visual alignment. After reviewing forensic science standards for DNA (match probability < 10^-6) and fingerprints (12-point minimum), we settled on ρ > 0.7, aligning with "strong effect" conventions while remaining achievable for gradient-based methods.

---

### Technique 5: Use Researcher Perspective

**Before (AI-like):**
> The results are shown in Table 2.

**After (Human-like):**
> Table 2 reveals a clear pattern: gradient-based methods (Grad-CAM, IG) reliably pass falsification (ρ > 0.7), while perturbation-based SHAP fails (ρ = 0.51). This aligns with our geometric intuition—gradient flow respects the manifold structure, while SHAP's combinatorial sampling does not.

---

### Technique 6: Conversational Forward References

**Before (AI-like):**
> Section 5 presents experiments.

**After (Human-like):**
> We validate this claim empirically in Section 5, where Grad-CAM achieves ρ = 0.82 on LFW.

---

### Technique 7: Strategic Passive Voice

**Use passive for:**
- Established facts: "ArcFace was proposed by Deng et al. [1]"
- Standard procedures: "Images were normalized to 112×112"
- Avoiding awkward "we": "The threshold was selected based on..." (not "We selected...")

**Use active "we" for:**
- Novel contributions: "We define the first falsifiable criterion..."
- Design decisions: "We chose LFW for reproducibility"
- Interpretation: "We interpret this as evidence that..."

## LATEX-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Use Real Academic LaTeX Patterns

**Natural theorem formatting:**
```latex
\begin{theorem}[Falsifiability Criterion]
\label{thm:falsifiability}
An attribution method $\phi$ is falsifiable if, for any input $x$...
\end{theorem}

Rather than the findings validate the criterion, we observe that Grad-CAM
satisfies Theorem~\ref{thm:falsifiability} with $\rho = 0.82$ (95\% CI [0.76, 0.88]).
```

**Natural citation flow:**
```latex
Grad-CAM~\citep{selvaraju2017grad} dominates visual explanation research,
though recent work~\citep{adebayo2018sanity} questions whether saliency maps
are meaningful. We address this through counterfactual validation.
```

**Natural equation integration:**
```latex
The geodesic distance on $\mathbb{S}^{511}$ is simply
%
\begin{equation}
d_g(\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2) = \arccos(\mathbf{e}_1 \cdot \mathbf{e}_2),
\end{equation}
%
which ranges from 0 (identical) to $\pi$ (opposite). For face verification,
genuine pairs typically yield $d_g < 0.8$ rad.
```

## WRITING PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Each Section:

1. **Draft in natural voice** (don't overthink)
2. **Read aloud** (catch unnatural phrasing)
3. **Vary rhythm** (sentence length, structure)
4. **Add researcher perspective** (show process, acknowledge surprises)
5. **Remove generic transitions** (let content flow naturally)
6. **Check citation integration** (mid-sentence, not just end)
7. **Break perfect parallelism** (lists, bullet points)
8. **One final read** (does it sound like YOU wrote it?)

## EXAMPLES: Before & After

### Example 1: Introduction

**BEFORE (AI-like):**
> Face verification systems are widely deployed. Explainable AI methods are used to provide transparency. However, these methods lack validation. This is a significant problem. Our work addresses this gap. We propose a falsifiable criterion. The criterion is based on counterfactual score prediction. Experiments validate our approach.

**AFTER (Human-like):**
> Face verification systems underpin everything from border control to financial authentication. To provide transparency, these systems deploy explainable AI (XAI) methods—typically Grad-CAM or SHAP—generating saliency maps for each decision. Yet a critical gap persists: no one validates these explanations. Saliency maps are produced, trusted, even submitted as evidence in court, but never tested scientifically.

> We address this through the first falsifiable criterion for attribution methods. Rather than assess plausibility (does the explanation look reasonable?) or faithfulness (does it correlate with model internals?), we demand testable predictions: if feature $i$ truly drives the decision, then perturbing $i$ should change the verification score predictably. Experiments on LFW demonstrate that Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients pass this test (ρ > 0.7), while SHAP fails—revealing that not all XAI methods are equally valid.

---

### Example 2: Related Work

**BEFORE (AI-like):**
> Several attribution methods exist. Grad-CAM is widely used [1]. Integrated Gradients provides theoretical guarantees [2]. SHAP offers model-agnostic explanations [3]. Previous work evaluated these methods [4][5][6]. However, falsifiability has not been studied. This work fills that gap.

**AFTER (Human-like):**
> Grad-CAM [1] dominated early visual explanation research, using gradient-weighted activation maps to highlight "important" regions. Sundararajan et al. [2] strengthened this with Integrated Gradients, which satisfies two key axioms (completeness and symmetry). SHAP [3] later unified these approaches through game theory, offering model-agnostic attribution at substantial computational cost (typically 100× slower than Grad-CAM on ResNet architectures).

> Prior work has evaluated these methods along two axes: plausibility (human agreement) [4,5] and faithfulness (model fidelity) [6,7]. Yet both miss a critical property—testability. Plausibility relies on subjective judgment; faithfulness measures correlation, not causation. Neither generates falsifiable predictions. Zhou et al. [8] noted this gap but proposed no solution. We do: counterfactual score prediction on the unit hypersphere.

---

### Example 3: Methodology

**BEFORE (AI-like):**
> The algorithm takes an image as input. Features are extracted. Attributions are computed. Counterfactuals are generated. The plausibility gate is applied. Delta scores are measured. The result is returned.

**AFTER (Human-like):**
> Algorithm 1 outlines our falsification protocol. Given an image pair $(x_1, x_2)$ and their embeddings $(\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2)$ from a pretrained ArcFace model, we first generate attributions $\phi(x_1)$ using the method under test (e.g., Grad-CAM). We then create counterfactuals by perturbing high-attribution features (expected large $\Delta s$) and low-attribution features (expected small $\Delta s$).

> A critical design choice is the plausibility gate (lines 4-6). Early experiments revealed that unrestricted perturbations produced adversarial examples—images with large score deltas but nonsensical appearance. Following Zhang et al. [18], we reject counterfactuals with LPIPS > 0.3, ensuring perceptual similarity. This costs us ~15% of generated counterfactuals but eliminates outliers that would inflate correlation.
