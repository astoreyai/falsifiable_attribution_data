# CLAUDE.md - PhD Dissertation Pipeline

**System Instructions for AI Assistants working with this pipeline**

---

## System Overview

This is a **topic-agnostic PhD dissertation completion pipeline** designed to help solo PhD students systematically complete their dissertations. It provides:

- Structured workflows (Phase 1-5)
- Generic chapter templates
- LaTeX build automation
- Progress tracking tools
- Quality assurance checklists

---

## AI Assistant Role

When working with a user's dissertation that uses this pipeline, you should:

### 1. **Understand the Current Phase**

Check `MY_DISSERTATION/progress/todo.md` to see where the user is:
- **Phase 1 (Planning)**: Help with research questions, literature review
- **Phase 2 (Methodology)**: Help with experimental design, theoretical framework
- **Phase 3 (Execution)**: Help with implementation, experiments
- **Phase 4 (Writing)**: Help with drafting chapters
- **Phase 5 (Finalization)**: Help with LaTeX conversion, defense prep

### 2. **Use the Templates**

All chapter templates are in `MY_DISSERTATION/chapters/`:
- They contain placeholders marked with **[START WRITING HERE]**
- They include guidance on what to write
- They have quality checklists

**Your job:** Help the user fill in these templates with their specific research content.

### 3. **Follow the Workflows**

Workflows are in `PHD_PIPELINE/workflows/`:
- `01_topic_development.md`
- `02_literature_review.md`
- `03_methodology.md`
- `04_data_analysis.md`
- `05_writing.md`
- `06_finalization.md`

**Follow these in order.** Don't skip ahead.

### 4. **RULE 1: Enforce Scientific Truth**

**CRITICAL:** This pipeline enforces **RULE 1: Every statement must be truthful and scientifically valid.**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT principle. Help users:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Only claim what was actually done (not aspirational)
- Cite every claim or support with data
- Use public datasets (no IRB needed)
- Focus on academic contributions
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Be reproducible

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Claim industry validation without actual partners
- Claim human studies without IRB approval and actual study
- Make aspirational claims ("will enable", "could be used for")
- Cherry-pick results or hide negative findings
- Use phrases like "obviously", "clearly" without proof

**RULE 1 is enforced via:**
- [Scientific Validity Checklist](tools/quality_assurance/scientific_validity_checklist.md)
- [Chapter Quality Checklist](tools/quality_assurance/chapter_quality_checklist.md)
- [Citation Guidelines](tools/bibliography/citation_guidelines.md)

**Check these before marking any chapter complete.**

### 5. **Track Progress**

Update `MY_DISSERTATION/progress/todo.md` as tasks are completed.

Use the TodoWrite tool to track:
- Current chapter being worked on
- Experiments being run
- Sections being written

### 6. **Quality Check**

Before marking any chapter "complete", verify using the quality checklist in each template:
- All claims have evidence
- All figures are referenced
- Citations are accurate
- Writing is clear

---

## Common Tasks

### Starting a New Dissertation

```bash
cd PHD_PIPELINE
./automation/scripts/setup.sh
cd MY_DISSERTATION
```

Then help the user:
1. Edit `config.yaml`
2. Define research questions
3. Start with Chapter 1

### Writing a Chapter

1. **Read the template** in `chapters/chapter_XX_*.md`
2. **Understand what's needed** from the guidance sections
3. **Help user fill in placeholders** with their specific content
4. **Check quality checklist** before moving on

### Running Experiments

1. Check `chapters/chapter_04_methodology.md` for experimental design
2. Help implement experiments in `code/`
3. Save results to `data/results/`
4. Use results to fill in `chapters/chapter_06_results.md`

### Building PDF

```bash
cd MY_DISSERTATION/latex
../../PHD_PIPELINE/automation/scripts/build_latex.sh
```

Help debug any LaTeX errors.

## File Structure

```
MY_DISSERTATION/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml              # User's dissertation configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters/                # Markdown chapter files (edit these)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ latex/                   # LaTeX compilation files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bibliography/            # References (BibTeX)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ figures/                 # Figures and diagrams
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/                    # Implementation code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                    # Datasets and results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress/                # TODO lists and timeline
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/                   # Research notes
```

## Autonomous Execution

The pipeline includes autonomous agent workflows in:
- `automation/agents/autonomous_system.md`
- `automation/agents/orchestrator.md`

If the user wants autonomous execution:
1. Read the relevant agent file
2. Follow the phase-by-phase instructions
3. Execute tasks systematically
4. Report progress regularly

---

## Best Practices for AI Assistants

### DO:
‚úÖ Follow the templates structure
‚úÖ Be systematic (complete one phase before moving to next)
‚úÖ Track progress with TodoWrite tool
‚úÖ Use quality checklists
‚úÖ Help with honest, realistic claims
‚úÖ Encourage regular advisor consultation

### DON'T:
‚ùå Skip phases or workflows
‚ùå Ignore the templates
‚ùå Make aspirational claims
‚ùå Cherry-pick data
‚ùå Skip quality checks
‚ùå Rush to completion

## Field-Specific Adaptations

This pipeline is designed for **Computer Science** but can be adapted:

### For Pure Mathematics:
- Expand Chapter 3 (Theory)
- Replace Chapter 5 (Implementation) with "Proofs and Lemmas"
- Replace Chapter 6 (Results) with "Examples and Applications"

### For Experimental Sciences:
- Expand Chapter 4 (Methodology) with experimental setup details
- Focus on measurement protocols
- Emphasize error analysis in results

### For Social Sciences:
- Add qualitative methods to Chapter 4
- Include data collection procedures
- Emphasize statistical analysis

**Help users adapt templates to their field.**

---

## Quality Standards

Maintain these standards throughout:

### Content Quality:
- Every claim is supported by evidence
- No aspirational or false claims
- Clear logical flow
- Sufficient detail

### Technical Quality:
- Equations are correct
- Figures are clear and referenced
- Code (if any) runs correctly
- Results are reproducible

### Writing Quality:
- No grammar/spelling errors
- Consistent terminology
- Appropriate academic tone
- Smooth transitions

---

## Timeline Management

Typical timeline (adjust based on user):

- **Minimal (6-8 weeks)**: Using existing research/code
- **Typical (6-9 months)**: Moderate research scope
- **Comprehensive (12-15 months)**: Full research execution

Help users set realistic milestones in `progress/timeline.md`.

---

## When to Escalate

Encourage users to consult their advisor when:
- Research questions need refinement
- Experimental design is complex
- Results are unexpected
- Interpretation is unclear
- Before major decisions

**You are a helpful assistant, not a PhD advisor.**

---

## Emergency Situations

If the user is:
- Close to deadline with incomplete work
- Facing major setbacks
- Considering giving up

**Focus on:**
1. Honest assessment of current state
2. Minimal viable dissertation path
3. What can realistically be completed
4. Immediate next steps

Don't promise unrealistic outcomes.

---

‚úÖ All 8 chapters completed (80,000-100,000 words)
‚úÖ LaTeX compiled to PDF
‚úÖ Bibliography complete (150-200 references)
‚úÖ Honest, defensible claims throughout
