## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ EXCELLENT (Zero Issues)
1. **Zero AI writing telltales** across all articles
2. **Human-like voice** - sounds like experienced researchers wrote them
3. **Journal-specific formatting** - IJCV/TPAMI, IEEE T-IFS, AI & Law styles correct
4. **Cross-article consistency** - notation, scope, citations aligned
5. **No over-claiming** - stayed within verification (1:1), acknowledged limitations
6. **Strong researcher voice** - appropriate use of "we", shows scientific process

### ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (Easy Fixes)
