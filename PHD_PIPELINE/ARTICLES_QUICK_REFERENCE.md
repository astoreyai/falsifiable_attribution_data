## TIMELINE (8‚Äì10 WEEKS)

### Sequential Approach (Recommended for Learning)
```
Week 3-5:  Article A (extract theory/method, plan experiments)
Week 4-6:  Article B (extract protocol, freeze thresholds)
Week 6-10: Article C (extract policy, write synthesis)
Week 6-8:  EXPERIMENTS (shared across A & B)
Week 9-10: FINALIZE ALL (polish, submit)
```

### Parallel Approach (Recommended for Speed)
```
Week 3-7:  ALL ARTICLES (extract content simultaneously)
Week 6-8:  EXPERIMENTS (shared across A & B)
Week 9-10: FINALIZE ALL (polish, submit)
```

## GETTING STARTED

### 1. Choose Your Article
- **Start with Article A?** (Theory/method, most foundational)
- **Start with Article B?** (Protocol/deployment, most practical)
- **Start with Article C?** (Policy, shortest and simplest)

### 2. Navigate to Folder
```bash
cd /home/aaron/projects/xai/PHD_PIPELINE/article_X/
```

### 3. Read Documentation
```bash
cat README.md       # Quick overview
cat WORKFLOW.md     # Detailed step-by-step
```

### 4. Begin Extraction
Follow Phase 1 instructions in `WORKFLOW.md`

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### For All Articles
‚úÖ **No scope creep** - Stay in verification (1:1), unit hypersphere, ArcFace/CosFace
‚úÖ **Honest limitations** - Acknowledge dataset/model/demographic constraints
‚úÖ **Reproducible** - Open code, public datasets
‚úÖ **No over-claiming** - Only claim what's proven

### Article-Specific
**Article A:**
- ‚úÖ Boxed theorem clearly states criterion
- ‚úÖ Experiments are minimal but decisive
- ‚úÖ Geometric interpretation is clear

**Article B:**
- ‚úÖ Thresholds pre-registered BEFORE experiments
- ‚úÖ Reporting template is complete and usable
- ‚úÖ NO post-hoc threshold changes

**Article C:**
- ‚úÖ Written for policy audience (minimal jargon)
- ‚úÖ Regulatory citations are accurate
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations

---

## EXPERIMENTS (SHARED ACROSS A & B)

### What You Need
- **Dataset:** LFW (public, reproducible)
- **Model:** Pretrained ArcFace (ResNet-50 or similar)
- **Attribution Methods:** 2‚Äì3 methods (Grad-CAM, IG, SHAP)
- **Compute:** Modest GPU (experiments are lean)

### What You'll Produce
- **For Article A:**
  - Scatter plot: predicted vs realized Œî-score
  - Results table: method ‚Üí correlation ‚Üí pass/fail
- **For Article B:**
  - Calibration plot: nominal vs actual coverage
  - Example reports: one NOT FALSIFIED, one FALSIFIED
  - Validation results table

### Timeline
- **Week 6:** Setup (dataset, model, methods)
- **Week 7:** Run tests (generate counterfactuals, measure Œî-prediction)
- **Week 8:** Visualize (create figures/tables, write results sections)
