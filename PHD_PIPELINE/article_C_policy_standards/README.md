**Full Title:** From "Meaningful Information" to Testable Explanations: Translating AI Act/GDPR/Daubert into XAI Validation for Face Verification

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Target Venues:** AI & Law, Forensic Science Policy & Management, CACM
**Timeline:** Weeks 6–10
**Article Type:** Policy Synthesis / Short Communications

---

## Quick Overview

This article extracts the **regulatory and evidentiary analysis** from the dissertation into a concise policy synthesis showing how legal requirements (AI Act, GDPR, Daubert) translate into concrete XAI validation standards.

### What This Article Provides

- **Regulatory requirements** (AI Act, GDPR, Daubert) in concise form
- **Evidentiary gap** analysis (current XAI practice vs legal requirements)
- **Minimal evidence requirements** (what compliance actually requires)
- **Compliance template** (simplified from Article B)
- **Policy recommendations** for regulators, auditors, developers, courts

### Target Length
6–8 pages (short communications format)

### Key Contribution
First **policy synthesis** translating legal "meaningful information" requirements into concrete, testable validation standards.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Read the Workflow
```bash
cat WORKFLOW.md
```

The workflow provides detailed instructions for:
- Extracting regulatory analysis from dissertation
- Creating policy-oriented tables
- Simplifying compliance template
- Writing for policy/legal audience
- Preparing submission materials

### Step 2: Extract Regulatory Analysis
Begin with regulatory requirements:
- Source: `../falsifiable_attribution_dissertation/chapters/chapter_02_literature_review.md` (regulatory sections)
- Target: `manuscript/article_C_draft.md` (section 2)
- Focus: AI Act, GDPR, Daubert

### Step 3: Follow the Workflow
See `WORKFLOW.md` for complete phase-by-phase instructions.

## Key Files to Create

### 1. Manuscript
- `manuscript/article_C_draft.md` - Main article text (6–8 pages)
- `manuscript/abstract.txt` - 150–200 word abstract
- `manuscript/keywords.txt` - 5–7 keywords
- `manuscript/compliance_template.md` - Simplified compliance template

### 2. Tables (2–3 total)
1. **Requirement → Current Practice → Gap** - Shows evidentiary gap
2. **Requirement → Minimal Evidence → Validation Method** - Shows compliance pathway
3. **Optional**: Summary of regulatory sources

### 3. Figures (optional)
1. **Synthesis flowchart** - Regulatory Requirement → Gap → Validation → Compliance

## Content Sources (from Dissertation)

| Article Section | Dissertation Source |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Introduction (1 page) | `chapters/chapter_01_introduction.md` + chapter_02 intro |
| Requirements (2 pages) | `chapters/chapter_02_literature_review.md` (regulatory) |
| Gap (1.5 pages) | `chapters/chapter_02_literature_review.md` (gap discussion) |
| Minimal Evidence (2 pages) | NEW - synthesize from chapters 2, 3, 4 |
| Compliance Template (1.5 pages) | Article B's template (simplified) |
| Discussion (1 page) | NEW - policy implications |

---

## What to Include vs Exclude

### ✅ INCLUDE in Article C
- Regulatory requirements (AI Act, GDPR, Daubert)
- Evidentiary gap (current practice vs requirements)
- Minimal evidence requirements (table)
- Compliance template (simplified)
- Policy implications
- Actionable recommendations

### ❌ EXCLUDE from Article C (save for other articles)
- Detailed technical implementation → Article B
- Theoretical proofs → Article A
- Experimental results → Articles A & B
- Over-claiming beyond face verification

---

## Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6 | Extract requirements, gap, create tables |
| 7 | Create compliance template, write discussion |
| 8 | Polish for policy audience |
| 9 | Internal review, revisions |
| 10 | Final polish, prepare submission |

---

## Success Criteria

Article C is complete when:

- [ ] Manuscript is 6–8 pages (short communications format)
- [ ] All regulatory citations are accurate
- [ ] 2–3 tables clearly show requirement → gap → evidence pathway
- [ ] Compliance template is simplified for policy audience
- [ ] Written for non-technical audience (minimal jargon)
- [ ] Policy implications are clear and actionable
- [ ] No over-claiming (stay within face verification scope)
- [ ] Ready for submission to AI & Law / Forensic Policy / CACM

- **Regulators**: Evaluating AI Act/GDPR compliance
- **Auditors**: Assessing XAI validation standards
- **Policy makers**: Understanding technical requirements
- **Legal professionals**: Daubert admissibility criteria
- **Developers**: Roadmap from requirements to evidence

## Key Tables

### Table 1: Requirement → Current Practice → Gap
```markdown
| Requirement (Source) | Current XAI Practice | Gap |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----|
| "Meaningful information" (GDPR) | Produce saliency maps | No faithfulness validation |
| Testability (Daubert) | Visual inspection | No falsifiable predictions |
| Error rates (Daubert, AI Act) | Not reported | No quantified uncertainty |
| Accuracy (AI Act) | Assumed high | No acceptance thresholds |
| Standards (Daubert) | Ad-hoc deployment | No published protocols |
```

### Table 2: Requirement → Minimal Evidence → Validation Method
```markdown
| Requirement (Source) | Minimal Evidence | Validation Method |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| "Meaningful information" (GDPR) | Faithful explanation | Δ-prediction test |
| Testability (Daubert) | Falsifiable criterion | Counterfactual score prediction |
| Error rates (Daubert, AI Act) | CI calibration, failure modes | Statistical validation |
| Accuracy (AI Act) | Quantified prediction accuracy | Correlation threshold |
| Standards (Daubert) | Pre-registered protocol | Published acceptance thresholds |
```

---

## Compliance Template (Simplified)

```markdown
## XAI Validation Report (Policy-Oriented)

**1. Method**: [e.g., Grad-CAM]
**2. Validation Results**:
   - Δ-prediction accuracy: ρ = 0.82 (threshold: ρ > 0.7) ✓
   - Confidence interval calibration: 94% (threshold: 90–100%) ✓
**3. Error Rates**:
   - Known failure modes: [list]
   - Rejection rate: 15%
**4. Limitations**:
   - Dataset: LFW (not demographically representative)
   - Model: ArcFace (not all architectures)
   - Scope: Verification (1:1) only
**5. Compliance Status**: COMPLIANT (passes all thresholds)
```

## Policy Implications

Article C should address:

### For Regulators
- What "meaningful information" (GDPR) concretely requires
- How to audit AI Act compliance (Arts. 13–15)
- What validation standards to enforce

### For Auditors
- Clear checklist: does XAI meet requirements?
- Minimal evidence standards
- Red flags (missing validation, no error rates)

### For Developers
- Roadmap from legal requirements to technical implementation
- Reference Article B for detailed protocol
- Compliance template to fill out

### For Courts (Daubert)
- What makes XAI evidence admissible
- Falsifiability criterion
- Error rates and uncertainty quantification

---

## Notes

- **Article C is the POLICY contribution** → prioritize clarity for non-technical audience
- **Stay concise** → 6–8 pages, short communications format
- **Avoid jargon** → explain technical terms simply
- **Actionable** → provide clear compliance pathway
- **Realistic** → acknowledge limits (face verification only, no demographic stratification yet)

---

## Relationship to Other Articles

- **Article A** provides the theoretical foundation (falsifiability criterion)
- **Article B** provides the technical implementation (protocol, thresholds)
- **Article C** provides the policy translation (legal requirements → validation standards)

If Articles A and B are published, cite them. If not, describe the approach generically.

## Next Steps

1. **Read** `WORKFLOW.md` for detailed instructions
2. **Extract** regulatory analysis from dissertation chapter 2
3. **Create** "Requirement → Current Practice → Gap" table
4. **Create** "Requirement → Minimal Evidence → Method" table
5. **Simplify** Article B's compliance template for policy audience
