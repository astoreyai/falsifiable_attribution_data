## Manuscript Structure (Complete)

### Section 1: Introduction (1 page)
**Content**:
- Legal/regulatory motivation for XAI validation
- Gap between regulatory requirements and technical practice
- Three urgent questions for policy makers
- Article roadmap

**Key Points**:
- EU AI Act, GDPR, Daubert all mandate explainability
- Current XAI practice generates explanations without validating faithfulness
- Creates "form vs. substance" compliance gap
- Proposes evidence-based validation framework

### Section 2: Regulatory & Evidentiary Requirements (2 pages)
**Content**:
- EU AI Act Articles 13-14 analysis
- GDPR Article 22 and Recital 71 interpretation
- Daubert standard (testability, error rates, standards, peer review, acceptance)
- Synthesis: Seven core evidentiary requirements

**Key Insights**:
- Legal language is vague ("meaningful," "appropriate," "comprehensible")
- No technical operationalization provided in regulations
- Creates legal uncertainty and enables checkbox compliance
- Requires translation into measurable criteria

### Section 3: The Evidentiary Gap (1.5 pages)
**Content**:
- Five systematic failures in current practice:
  1. No validation of faithfulness
  2. No quantified error rates
  3. No standardized protocols
  4. No testability/falsifiability
  5. Confounding model accuracy with explanation accuracy
- Evidence from empirical studies (40-69% accuracy, low reliability)
- Form vs. substance compliance gap

**Key Findings**:
- Current practice satisfies literal regulatory language (form) but fails policy intent (substance)
- Empirical studies show attribution methods are unreliable (α < 0.48, 40-69% accuracy)
- Enables "checkbox compliance" without meaningful accountability

### Section 4: Minimal Evidence Requirements (2 pages) **[NEW SYNTHESIS]**
**Content**:
- Operationalization of all 7 requirements:
  1. Meaningful Information (GDPR) → Counterfactual ρ ≥ 0.70
  2. Testability (Daubert) → Perturbation p < 0.05, d ≥ 0.5
  3. Error Rates (Daubert/AI Act) → 90-95% CI coverage + failure docs
  4. Accuracy (AI Act) → ≥80% ground truth accuracy
  5. Standards (Daubert) → Peer-reviewed + public benchmark + pre-registered
  6. Comprehensibility (AI Act) → ≥75% correct interpretation
  7. Oversight (AI Act) → AUC ≥ 0.75 discrimination

**Key Contribution**:
- First systematic operationalization of vague legal concepts
- Measurable thresholds grounded in statistical practice
- Analogies to forensic science standards (DNA, fingerprints)
- Minimal compliance checklist

### Section 5: Compliance Template (1.5 pages)
**Content**:
- Structured template for practitioners
- 7 requirement sections with evidence fields
- Pass/fail assessment for each requirement
- Overall compliance status (Full/Partial/Non-compliant)
- Deployment recommendation framework
- Complete filled example (Grad-CAM on ArcFace showing 3/7 pass → partial compliance → approved with restrictions)

**Key Value**:
- Enables systematic compliance assessment
- Translates technical metrics into legal documentation
- Provides decision framework for deployment
- Includes realistic example showing how to handle partial compliance

### Section 6: Discussion & Policy Implications (1.5 pages)
**Content**:
- Recommendations for 4 stakeholder groups:
  1. **Regulators**: Establish technical standards, mandate validation protocols, require error rate disclosure
  2. **Developers**: Validation-first development, benchmark participation, uncertainty quantification
  3. **Auditors**: Standardized protocols, independent validation, red team testing
  4. **Courts**: Daubert challenges, expert witness standards, jury instructions
- Who benefits: defendants, law enforcement, regulators, developers, courts, society
- Remaining gaps: threshold consensus, dynamic adaptation, harmonization, fairness
- Call for evidence-based policy

**Key Messages**:
- Current practice is scientifically indefensible and legally untenable
- Evidence-based standards are feasible (analogous to DNA analysis evolution)
- Multi-stakeholder collaboration required
- Validation is necessary but not sufficient for ethical deployment

### Section 7: Conclusion (1 page)
**Content**:
- Summary of evidentiary gap
- Seven requirements with operationalized thresholds
- Form vs. substance compliance distinction
- Path forward: evidence-based policy
- Urgency (wrongful arrests, regulatory mandates)

## Key Policy Insights Synthesized

### 1. The Form vs. Substance Gap
**Insight**: Current XAI practice achieves compliance in form (systems generate explanations, documentation describes methods) but fails compliance in substance (explanations not validated, error rates unknown, no standards).

**Policy Implication**: Regulators must close this gap by requiring validation evidence, not just explanation generation.

### 2. Vague Legal Language Enables Checkbox Compliance
**Insight**: Terms like "meaningful information," "appropriate transparency," and "comprehensible" lack technical operationalization, creating legal uncertainty.

**Policy Implication**: Standards bodies (NIST, ISO) must publish technical specifications translating legal requirements into measurable criteria.

### 3. Explanations Are Not Automatically Reliable
**Insight**: High model accuracy (99.7% face verification) does not guarantee explanation accuracy (40-76% attribution accuracy). These are empirically independent.

**Policy Implication**: Validation requirements must apply to explanations separately from model predictions—both must be validated.

### 4. Testability Is Fundamental
**Insight**: Current XAI outputs (static heatmaps) are unfalsifiable—they make no testable predictions that could be experimentally refuted.

**Policy Implication**: Daubert standard requires testability. XAI evidence may fail admissibility unless methods generate falsifiable predictions.

### 5. Error Rate Disclosure Is Essential
**Insight**: Explanation faithfulness varies dramatically by conditions (pose, image quality, demographics, score range), yet these conditional error rates are not reported.

**Policy Implication**: Forensic deployment requires comprehensive error rate documentation, analogous to DNA analysis error rate disclosure.

### 6. Standardization Is Achievable
**Insight**: Other forensic domains (DNA, fingerprints, ballistics) evolved from ad-hoc practice to rigorous standards. Face verification XAI stands at same inflection point.

**Policy Implication**: Community collaboration (researchers, practitioners, regulators, civil liberties advocates) can establish consensus standards. Precedent exists.

### 7. Validation Protects Multiple Stakeholders
**Insight**: Validated explanations serve aligned interests: defendants (challenge unreliable evidence), law enforcement (avoid liability), courts (streamline admissibility), society (civil liberties + beneficial use).

**Policy Implication**: Validation standards are not anti-technology—they enable responsible deployment by establishing scientific rigor.
