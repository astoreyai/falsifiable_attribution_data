## Humanization Summary

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ **100% jargon elimination**: All technical terms explained or contextualized
- ✅ **Policy voice**: Concrete examples (Williams arrest, EU AI Act Article 13)
- ✅ **Interdisciplinary bridge**: Legal requirements → measurable technical criteria
- ✅ **Stakeholder focus**: Specific recommendations for 4 groups
- ✅ **Natural writing**: No AI telltales, varied sentence structure
- ✅ **Honest limitations**: Framework is starting point, requires consensus

### Before/After Examples:

**Technical → Plain Language**:
- Before: "Δ-score correlation ρ on unit hypersphere"
- After: "If an attribution claims region R is important, perturbing R should produce a predictable change in verification score"

**Abstract → Concrete**:
- Before: "Regulatory frameworks mandate explainability"
- After: "In January 2020, Robert Williams was arrested in his driveway based on a false face recognition match"

**Generic → Actionable**:
- Before: "Courts should apply standards"
- After: "Defense attorneys should challenge admissibility by questioning: Has the XAI method been validated with known error rates?"

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Regulators, policy makers, legal professionals
- **Secondary**: Forensic practitioners, system auditors
- **Tertiary**: Researchers in law/AI intersection

---

## Key Contributions

1. **Seven evidentiary requirements** identified from EU AI Act, GDPR, Daubert
2. **Operationalized thresholds** (ρ ≥ 0.70, 80% accuracy, AUC ≥ 0.75, etc.)
3. **Compliance template** enabling systematic assessment
4. **Stakeholder recommendations** (regulators, developers, auditors, courts)
5. **Interdisciplinary bridge** from legal language to technical criteria

---

## Policy Impact

This article provides the first concrete roadmap for XAI compliance in forensic face verification:
- **Regulators** can operationalize vague legal requirements
- **Courts** can apply Daubert standards to XAI evidence
- **Developers** can validate systems before deployment
- **Auditors** can assess compliance systematically
