## What Is This?

This is a **topic-agnostic, autonomous PhD dissertation completion pipeline** designed to help solo PhD students systematically complete their dissertations using:

- Structured workflows and templates
- Autonomous execution frameworks
- Quality assurance checklists
- LaTeX build automation
- Progress tracking tools

## Key Features

✅ **Topic-Agnostic**: Works for any PhD research area (CS, Engineering, Sciences, Humanities)
✅ **Autonomous**: AI-assisted workflows for systematic execution
✅ **Template-Based**: Pre-built chapter templates following standard dissertation structure
✅ **Quality-Focused**: Built-in quality checklists and progress tracking
✅ **LaTeX Integration**: Automated conversion and compilation to PDF
✅ **Realistic**: Designed for solo PhD students without IRB/industry requirements

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Pipeline to Your Project

```bash
cp -r PHD_PIPELINE /path/to/your/dissertation/project/
cd /path/to/your/dissertation/project/PHD_PIPELINE
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your Dissertation

```bash
./automation/scripts/setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a `MY_DISSERTATION/` folder
- Copy all templates with placeholders
- Initialize progress tracking
- Setup LaTeX build environment

### Step 3: Configure Your Topic

Edit `MY_DISSERTATION/config.yaml`:

```yaml
title: "Your Dissertation Title Here"
author: "Your Name"
degree: "PhD in [Your Field]"
university: "Your University"
advisor: "Dr. Advisor Name"
topic_area: "Brief description of your research area"
timeline_months: 12  # Adjust based on your needs
```

### Step 4: Start Working

Follow the workflows in order:

1. [Topic Development](workflows/01_topic_development.md)
2. [Literature Review](workflows/02_literature_review.md)
3. [Methodology](workflows/03_methodology.md)
4. [Data Analysis](workflows/04_data_analysis.md)
5. [Writing](workflows/05_writing.md)
6. [Finalization](workflows/06_finalization.md)

## Who Is This For?

### ✅ Perfect For:

- **Solo PhD students** writing dissertations independently
- **Researchers** using public datasets (no IRB required)
- **Computational research** (theory + implementation + experiments)
- **Self-directed learners** who want systematic workflows
- **Anyone** who wants to finish their PhD efficiently

### ❌ Not Ideal For:

- Human subjects research requiring IRB approval
- Industry partnerships or external validation
- Multi-author collaborative dissertations
- Non-computational research requiring lab equipment

---

## Design Philosophy

### 1. **RULE 1: Scientific Truth**
**Every statement must be truthful and scientifically valid**

- ✅ Every claim must be cited or supported by data
- ✅ No aspirational claims (only what was actually done)
- ✅ No industry validation without actual partners
- ✅ No human studies without IRB approval
- ✅ Results must be reproducible

**Enforced via:**
- [Scientific Validity Checklist](tools/quality_assurance/scientific_validity_checklist.md)
- [Chapter Quality Checklist](tools/quality_assurance/chapter_quality_checklist.md)
- [Citation Guidelines](tools/bibliography/citation_guidelines.md)
- [Systematic Literature Review Tools](tools/literature_review/) (PRISMA compliance)

### 2. **Honest and Realistic**
- No false claims or aspirational goals
- Only include what you can actually achieve
- Focus on academic contribution, not industry validation

### 3. **Systematic and Structured**
- Clear phases with defined deliverables
- Quality checkpoints at each stage
- Progress tracking built-in

### 4. **Autonomous Execution**
- AI-assisted workflows for efficiency
- Automated quality checks
- Template-based generation

### 5. **Flexibility**
- Adapt templates to your field
- Skip irrelevant sections
- Customize timelines
