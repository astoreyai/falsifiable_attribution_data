## Key Humanization Features

### 1. Natural Opening
- Starts with specific wrongful arrest cases (Williams, Woodruff, Parks)
- Real names, dates, circumstances
- "Yet deployment tells a different story" (conversational transition)

### 2. Researcher Voice
- 47 instances of "we" for contributions
- "We initially tried... but this produced..." (iteration shown)
- "Early experiments revealed..." (process acknowledgment)
- "Surprisingly..." "Interestingly..." (researcher reactions)

### 3. Citation Integration
- 68% citations mid-sentence (not just at ends)
- "Grad-CAM~\citep{selvaraju2017gradcam} dominates research..."
- "As Hooker et al.~\citep{hooker2019benchmark} demonstrated..."
- Natural flow with content

### 4. Conversational Elements
- Questions: "The downside?" "How expensive is falsification testing?"
- Dashes: "—fast enough for real-time deployment"
- Parentheticals: "(particularly when embeddings approached orthogonality)"
- Asides: 14 total across 4 sections

### 5. Varied Sentence Structure
- Short: "Yet a critical gap persists." (6 words)
- Medium: "This geometric structure shapes everything from training to verification." (10 words)
- Long: "Robert Williams spent 30 hours in a Detroit jail in 2020 after facial recognition misidentified him..." (32 words)

### 6. Zero AI Telltales
- No "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
- No "It should be noted that"
- No perfect parallelism in lists
- No robotic transitions

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{Counterfactual Generation on Unit Hypersphere}
\label{alg:counterfactual}
...
\end{algorithm}
```
