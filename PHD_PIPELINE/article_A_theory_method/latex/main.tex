\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Face verification systems achieve near-perfect accuracy on benchmark datasets, yet their deployment in forensic contexts has led to documented wrongful arrests. Explainable AI (XAI) methods—Grad-CAM, SHAP, Integrated Gradients—generate visual attributions to explain verification decisions, but these explanations lack scientific validity: there exists no mechanism to test whether an explanation is correct or incorrect. Following Popper's falsifiability criterion, we argue that explanations must make testable, refutable predictions about model behavior. We introduce the first falsifiability framework for attribution methods in face verification, reformulating attributions as counterfactual predictions on unit hypersphere embeddings. Our contributions include: (1) a theorem establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for falsifiable attributions (differential geodesic distance predictions with statistical separation), (2) a gradient-based algorithm for generating minimal counterfactuals respecting non-Euclidean geometry, and (3) computational complexity analysis proving $O(K \cdot T \cdot D)$ tractability. Unlike prior work adapting classification XAI to verification, our framework is purpose-built for pairwise similarity on hypersphere embeddings, addressing the unique geometric challenges of metric learning spaces. This work provides a scientific foundation for validating explanations in high-stakes forensic applications.
