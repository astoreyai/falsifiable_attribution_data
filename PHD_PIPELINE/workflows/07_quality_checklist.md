## üìä HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST

1. **Sequential Completion**: Work through stages in order
2. **Quality Gates**: Don't advance until current stage checks are complete
3. **Iteration Friendly**: Return to earlier stages as needed
4. **Documentation**: Save all outputs for each completed item
5. **Committee Review**: Schedule committee reviews at key milestones

## üö® RISK MANAGEMENT

### Common Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Warning Signs | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Scope Creep** | Topic keeps expanding, RQs multiplying | Return to Stage 1, refocus, get advisor to confirm boundaries |
| **Recruitment Failure** | Can't find participants, low response rate | Have backup plan, expand criteria, extend timeline, consult advisor |
| **Data Quality Issues** | Lots of missing data, suspect responses | Improve protocols, additional quality checks, larger sample |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Can't decide on analysis approach, keep reanalyzing | Follow analysis plan, consult expert, set deadline |
| **Writer's Block** | Can't write, avoiding dissertation | Set small daily goals, write badly first then edit, accountability partner |
| **Committee Conflict** | Members disagree on approach/direction | Address early, involve chair/advisor, document decisions |
| **Timeline Slippage** | Behind schedule, missing milestones | Reassess timeline, identify bottlenecks, seek help |
| **Burnout** | Exhaustion, lack of motivation, health issues | Take breaks, seek support, adjust expectations, remember why you started |
