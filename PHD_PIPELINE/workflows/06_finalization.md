## ü§ñ AI PROMPT CHAINS

### Prompt 6.1: Write the Abstract

**USER INPUT REQUIRED:**
- Word limit (check your university requirements, usually 250-350 words)
- All 8 chapters (for extracting key information)
- Research questions (from Chapter 1)
- Key findings (from Chapter 6)

**PROMPT:**
```
I need to write a dissertation abstract with the following constraints:

REQUIREMENTS:
- Word limit: [250 words for some institutions, 350 for others - CHECK YOUR REQUIREMENTS]
- Must be self-contained (understandable without reading dissertation)
- Must follow this structure:

STRUCTURE (allocate words carefully):
1. Background/Context (20-30 words, 1-2 sentences)
   - What is the broad area?
   - Why does this area matter?

2. Problem/Gap (30-40 words, 2 sentences)
   - What specific problem exists?
   - What gap in knowledge/practice?

3. Purpose Statement (15-25 words, 1 sentence)
   - "This dissertation [verb: investigates/develops/evaluates]..."
   - State clear objective

4. Research Questions (20-30 words, 1-2 sentences)
   - List 2-3 main RQs (brief versions)
   - OR state overarching RQ

5. Methodology (40-60 words, 2-3 sentences)
   - Research approach (quantitative/qualitative/mixed)
   - Data collection method
   - Sample/dataset
   - Analysis method

6. Key Findings (80-100 words, 3-5 sentences)
   - Answer to RQ1: [finding + metric if quantitative]
   - Answer to RQ2: [finding + metric if quantitative]
   - Answer to RQ3: [finding + metric if quantitative]
   - **This is the MOST IMPORTANT section - allocate most words here**

7. Conclusions/Implications (40-60 words, 2-3 sentences)
   - Theoretical contribution
   - Practical implication
   - Significance statement

MY DISSERTATION DETAILS:
- Title: [paste full title]
- Field: [e.g., Computer Science, Education, Psychology]
- Research Questions: [paste RQs from Chapter 1]
- Methodology: [brief: e.g., "Mixed methods with n=250 survey + 30 interviews"]
- Key Findings:
  - RQ1: [paste key finding with metrics]
  - RQ2: [paste key finding with metrics]
  - RQ3: [paste key finding with metrics]
- Main Contribution: [paste 1-sentence contribution statement from Chapter 1]

Please help me draft an abstract that:
1. Stays within [X] word limit
2. Follows the structure above
3. Is clear and jargon-free
4. Highlights quantitative results (specific numbers)
5. Is suitable for interdisciplinary readers
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
- First draft of abstract (250-350 words)
- Word count breakdown by section
- Suggestions for cutting/expanding if over/under limit

**ITERATION TIPS:**
- **Iteration 1:** Get all content in (likely over word limit)
- **Iteration 2:** Cut ruthlessly to meet word limit
  - Remove: "This dissertation", "The results show that"
  - Use active voice: "We found" not "It was found that"
  - Combine sentences
- **Iteration 3:** Ensure clarity and flow
- **Iteration 4:** Check keywords are present (for searchability)
- **Iteration 5:** Proofread

**SAVE AS:** `/06_Finalization/abstract_v1.md`, `/06_Finalization/abstract_v2.md`, ... `/06_Finalization/abstract_FINAL.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES:**
- ‚ùå Using jargon without definition
- ‚ùå Being too vague ("Results were positive")
- ‚ùå Omitting quantitative results (always include metrics!)
- ‚ùå Going over word limit (will be rejected by Graduate School)
- ‚ùå Including citations (abstracts typically have no citations)

---

### Prompt 6.2: Finalize References

**USER INPUT REQUIRED:**
- Citation style (APA 7th, Chicago, MLA, IEEE, etc. - CHECK YOUR REQUIREMENTS)
- Reference manager software (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, or manual)
- Access to all chapters (to check in-text citations)

**PROMPT:**
```
I need to create a perfect reference list for my dissertation.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Citation style: [APA 7th / Chicago / MLA / IEEE - specify]
- Current reference count: [e.g., 187 references]
- Reference manager: [Zotero / Mendeley / EndNote / Manual]

TASK 1: REFERENCE LIST FORMATTING
Help me ensure my reference list is formatted correctly:

1. ALPHABETICAL ORDER:
   - Last name, First initial format (APA)
   - Alphabetical by first author's last name
   - Multiple works by same author: chronological order

2. HANGING INDENT:
   - First line flush left
   - Subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches

3. SPACING:
   - Double-spaced throughout (APA)
   - No extra space between entries

4. COMMON REFERENCE TYPES (provide format for each):
   - Journal article (with DOI)
   - Journal article (without DOI)
   - Book
   - Book chapter
   - Dissertation/Thesis
   - Conference paper
   - Website/Online source
   - Software/Code repository
   - Dataset

TASK 2: IN-TEXT CITATION CHECK
Help me verify citation consistency:

1. ORPHAN CITATIONS (in-text citation but no reference entry):
   - How to find: Search for (Author, Year) patterns in text
   - How to fix: Add reference entry OR remove citation

2. ORPHAN REFERENCES (reference entry but never cited):
   - How to find: Use reference manager's "unused references" feature
   - How to fix: Remove from reference list OR add citation to text

3. INCONSISTENT AUTHOR NAMES:
   - Check: "Smith, J." in text vs. "Smith, John" in references
   - Standardize to one format

TASK 3: COMMON ERRORS TO CHECK

For APA 7th specifically:
- [ ] DOIs formatted as https://doi.org/10.xxxx (not doi: or dx.doi.org)
- [ ] Article titles in sentence case (not title case)
- [ ] Journal names in title case and italicized
- [ ] Book titles in sentence case and italicized
- [ ] Volume numbers italicized, issue numbers not italicized
- [ ] "Retrieved from" only for unstable URLs (not for journal articles)
- [ ] Author names: Last, F. M. (not Last, First Middle)
- [ ] "et al." for 21+ authors in reference list, all authors for <21
- [ ] Year in parentheses: (2023). not 2023. or (2023)
- [ ] No period after DOI

TASK 4: REFERENCE MANAGER EXPORT
If using reference manager:
1. Select all references in library
2. Check for duplicates (remove)
3. Verify all fields complete (especially DOIs, page numbers)
4. Export as [APA 7th / Chicago / etc.] formatted bibliography
5. Copy into Word/LaTeX dissertation document
6. Manually check formatting (managers sometimes make errors)

TASK 5: MANUAL FORMATTING (if not using reference manager)
1. List all references alphabetically in spreadsheet
2. Format each reference according to style guide
3. Double-check against official examples
4. Copy into dissertation document
5. Apply hanging indent formatting
```

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
- Formatted reference list (100-200 references typical)
- Citation consistency report (orphan citations/references identified)
- Corrected reference formatting

**TOOLS:**
- **APA 7th:** https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references
- **Chicago:** https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
- **Zotero:** Free, open-source reference manager
- **Citation Checker:** Many universities have citation formatting tools

**SAVE AS:** `/06_Finalization/references_formatted.docx`

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:**
- Incomplete references (missing DOI, page numbers) may cause Graduate School rejection
- Inconsistent formatting throughout will require revision before final submission
- Budget 4-6 hours for thorough reference checking

#### TOOLS AND STRATEGIES

**Tool 1: Grammarly**
```
1. Install Grammarly (browser extension or desktop app)
2. Upload dissertation to Grammarly
3. Review all suggestions
4. Accept/reject based on context
5. Note: Grammarly sometimes suggests incorrect changes for technical writing - use judgment
```

**Tool 2: Text-to-Speech (Read Aloud)**
```
1. Word: Review ‚Üí Read Aloud
2. Or: Natural Reader (free online tool)
3. Listen while following along
4. Catches errors you'd miss reading silently
5. Particularly good for awkward phrasing
```

**Tool 3: Print Reading**
```
1. Print dissertation (or at least key chapters)
2. Read with pen in hand
3. Mark errors directly on paper
4. Studies show: people catch more errors on paper than screen
```

**Tool 4: Peer Proofreading**
```
1. Ask colleague/friend to proofread 1-2 chapters (not entire dissertation - too much)
2. Focus on Introduction and Conclusion (most visible chapters)
3. Provide specific guidance: "Check for typos and awkward phrasing, not content"
4. Reciprocate (offer to proofread their work)
```

**Tool 5: University Writing Center**
```
1. Many universities offer dissertation proofreading services
2. Book appointment 2-3 weeks in advance (they're busy near deadlines)
3. They can catch errors you've become blind to
4. Note: They may only review excerpt (e.g., 30 pages) - choose Introduction, Conclusion, 1 other chapter
```

**Tool 6: Plagiarism Check**
```
1. Run through Turnitin or similar (your university may provide access)
2. Should be <10% similarity (excluding references)
3. High similarity in specific sections may indicate insufficient paraphrasing
4. Note: Some similarity is expected (common phrases, your own published papers)
```

WHY THIS WORK MATTERS

[One compelling image or statistic]

Example:
‚Ä¢ "AI systems make 1 billion+ decisions daily"
‚Ä¢ [Image: AI in healthcare, finance, law enforcement]

Problem: These systems are often BLACK BOXES
‚Üí Lack of transparency
‚Üí Inability to trust or debug

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**What to say:**
> "Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement. However, these systems are often black boxes - we can't understand why they make the decisions they do. This lack of transparency creates serious problems for trust, accountability, and debugging."

THE PROBLEM: Current XAI Methods Are Too Slow

[Bar chart comparing methods]

Method          | Latency
----------------|----------
Grad-CAM        | 18 ms     ‚úì Fast
LIME            | 890 ms    ‚úó Slow
SHAP            | 2,300 ms  ‚úó Very Slow

‚ùå Existing methods: either fast but unfaithful, or faithful but slow
‚ùå No method achieves real-time + high-quality explanations

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**What to say:**
> "Existing explainability methods face a critical trade-off. Fast methods like Grad-CAM take only 18 milliseconds but are often unfaithful to the model. High-quality methods like SHAP are faithful but take over 2 seconds - far too slow for real-time applications. No method achieves both real-time performance and high-quality explanations."

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

RQ1: Can we achieve <50ms latency while maintaining
     >0.7 faithfulness (insertion AUC)?

RQ2: Can we integrate explainability into the model
     architecture with <1% accuracy degradation?

RQ3: Can we ensure demographic fairness with <10%
     variance across groups?

```

**What to say:**
> "This dissertation addresses three research questions. First, can we achieve real-time explanations - under 50 milliseconds - while maintaining high faithfulness? Second, can we integrate explainability directly into the model architecture without sacrificing accuracy? And third, can we ensure explanations are fair across demographic groups?"

KEY THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION

Novel SHAP Formulation for Hypersphere Embeddings

Standard SHAP:     œÜ·µ¢ = Œ£ [v(S ‚à™ {i}) - v(S)]
                        (for Euclidean spaces)

Our Formulation:   œÜ·µ¢ = Œ£ [d‚Çê(S ‚à™ {i}) - d‚Çê(S)]
                        (for hypersphere spaces)

‚úì Preserves all 4 Shapley axioms
‚úì Reduces complexity: O(2^M) ‚Üí O(M log M)

[Simple diagram showing Euclidean vs. hypersphere geometry]

```

**What to say:**
> "Our key theoretical contribution is a novel SHAP formulation for hypersphere embeddings, which are used in facial recognition systems. Standard SHAP assumes Euclidean geometry, but facial embeddings lie on a hypersphere. Our formulation adapts SHAP to this geometry while preserving all Shapley axioms and reducing computational complexity from exponential to logarithmic."

Component                    | Insertion AUC | Latency
-----------------------------|---------------|----------
Full FastSHAP                | 0.73          | 42 ms
- Hierarchical approximation | 0.71 (-0.02)  | 65 ms (+23ms)
- Attention-guided sampling  | 0.68 (-0.05)  | 48 ms (+6ms)
- GPU acceleration           | 0.73 (same)   | 125 ms (+83ms)

Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Hierarchical approximation: Crucial for speed
‚Ä¢ Attention sampling: Crucial for faithfulness
‚Ä¢ GPU acceleration: Essential for real-time

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**What to say:**
> "Our ablation study shows that all three components are essential. Removing hierarchical approximation increases latency by 23 milliseconds. Removing attention sampling decreases faithfulness by 0.05. And removing GPU acceleration makes the method 3 times slower. Each component plays a critical role."

**Time:** 1-1.5 minutes

THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

1. SHAP can be adapted to non-Euclidean spaces
   ‚Üí Opens door for SHAP on graphs, manifolds, etc.

2. Explainability and accuracy are not mutually exclusive
   ‚Üí E-ViT achieved BOTH (+0.5% accuracy)
   ‚Üí Explanation as regularization

3. Fairness requires explicit calibration
   ‚Üí Uncalibrated methods exhibit demographic bias
   ‚Üí Calibration is necessary, not optional

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**What to say:**
> "This work has three main theoretical implications. First, SHAP can be successfully adapted to non-Euclidean spaces like hyperspheres, opening the door for SHAP on graphs and manifolds. Second, explainability and accuracy are not mutually exclusive - our E-ViT achieved both. And third, fairness requires explicit calibration - it doesn't emerge automatically from faithful explanations."

LIMITATIONS

1. Generalization
   ‚Üí Tested only on facial recognition
   ‚Üí May not transfer to other vision tasks

2. Approximation Error
   ‚Üí 0.73 AUC vs. 0.78 for vanilla SHAP
   ‚Üí 0.05 trade-off for 55√ó speedup

3. Calibration Overhead
   ‚Üí Requires demographic labels for fairness
   ‚Üí May not be available in all domains

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

**What to say:**
> "This work has three main limitations. First, we tested only on facial recognition - generalization to other vision tasks remains to be demonstrated. Second, there's a small approximation error compared to vanilla SHAP - a 0.05 AUC trade-off for 55 times speedup. And third, fairness calibration requires demographic labels, which may not be available in all domains."

#### SLIDE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

**1. MINIMAL TEXT**
- **Rule:** Max 6 bullet points per slide, max 6 words per bullet ("6x6 rule")
- **Why:** You're speaking, not reading slides to committee
- **Example:**
  - ‚ùå "The results of our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieved 42 milliseconds latency"
  - ‚úÖ "FastSHAP: 42 ms latency" (you say the rest)

**2. LARGE FONTS**
- **Minimum:** 20pt for body text, 28pt for headings
- **Why:** Readability in large room or via Zoom
- **Check:** Can you read slide from 10 feet away?

**3. HIGH-QUALITY FIGURES**
- **Resolution:** 300+ DPI for images
- **Clarity:** Simple, clear, not cluttered
- **Labels:** All axes labeled, legends present
- **Colors:** Colorblind-friendly (avoid red/green)

**4. CONSISTENT STYLE**
- **Template:** Use university template or professional template (Beamer, PowerPoint built-ins)
- **Colors:** Max 3-4 colors throughout
- **Fonts:** One font family (e.g., Arial throughout, or Times throughout)

**5. VISUAL HIERARCHY**
- **Headings:** Largest, bold
- **Subheadings:** Medium, bold
- **Body:** Smallest
- **Emphasis:** Use color or bold, not underline

---

#### ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & PREPARATION

**Common Question Types:**

**1. CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS**
> "Can you explain how you calculated X?"
> "What exactly do you mean by Y?"

**Preparation:**
- Know your methods inside-out
- Have backup slides with technical details
- Be ready to draw on whiteboard/paper

**2. CHALLENGE QUESTIONS**
> "Why didn't you use method Z instead?"
> "Isn't your sample size too small?"

**Preparation:**
- For every design choice, know: why you made it, what alternatives exist, why alternatives were inferior
- Have references ready: "Smith (2020) also used n=250 for similar study"

**3. EXTENSION QUESTIONS**
> "How would this apply to domain X?"
> "What if you relaxed assumption Y?"

**Preparation:**
- Think through extensions (what you put in "Future Work")
- It's OK to say "I haven't studied that, but I speculate..."

**4. PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS**
> "What is the broader impact of this work?"
> "What are the ethical implications?"

**Preparation:**
- Connect to big picture (EU AI Act, algorithmic accountability)
- Be thoughtful, not dismissive

---

#### Q&A STRATEGIES

**Strategy 1: The Pause**
- Don't rush to answer
- Pause 2-3 seconds to think
- It's OK to say "That's a good question, let me think..."

**Strategy 2: Clarify If Needed**
- If question is unclear: "Just to make sure I understand, are you asking about X or Y?"
- Rephrasing shows you're listening

**Strategy 3: Bridge Back to Your Work**
- Answer question, then connect to your contribution
- Example: "That's an interesting point about generalization. In our work, we focused on facial recognition, but the hierarchical framework could potentially extend to [domain]."

**Strategy 4: "I Don't Know" is OK**
- If you truly don't know: admit it
- Then: "But here's how I would approach finding out..." (shows problem-solving)

**Strategy 5: Redirect Hostile Questions**
- If question seems hostile: stay calm, reframe neutrally
- Example: "I hear your concern about sample size. Let me explain the power analysis that justified n=250..."
