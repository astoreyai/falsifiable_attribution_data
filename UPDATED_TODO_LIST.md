git push
```

**Why Critical:**
- Backs up 31 hours of infrastructure work
- Protects 148,268 lines of code
- Prevents catastrophic loss from hardware failure
- **Risk if skipped:** Total loss of Phase 1 work

**Impact:** Critical safety measure, enables collaborative work, version control

---

#### Day 1-2: Download CelebA Dataset (30-60 minutes)
**Priority: P0 - Unblocks Phase 2**

```bash
cd /home/aaron/projects/xai
python data/download_celeba.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Downloads 4 files (~1.5 GB total)
  - img_align_celeba.zip (202,599 images)
  - list_attr_celeba.txt (attributes)
  - list_eval_partition.txt (train/val/test split)
  - identity_CelebA.txt (identity mappings)
- Automatic extraction and verification
- Final structure: `/home/aaron/projects/xai/data/celeba/celeba/img_align_celeba/`

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
python data/download_celeba.py --verify-only
```

**Why Critical:**
- Unblocks multi-dataset validation (+11-14 defense points)
- Addresses biggest committee concern: "Does this generalize beyond LFW?"
- Enables Chapter 8 Section 8.2.4 completion

**Impact:** Defense readiness 83/100 → 91-94/100 (after experiments)

**Fallback if Download Fails:**
1. **VGGFace2:** Alternative large-scale dataset (9,131 identities)
2. **Kaggle API:** CelebA available on Kaggle (kaggle datasets download -d jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)
3. **Manual Download:** Google Drive direct download (slower, same files)

---

#### Day 1: Register for CFP-FP Access (5 minutes + 1-3 days approval)
**Priority: P1 - Parallel Path**

```bash
python data/download_cfp_fp.py
# Follow registration instructions printed
```

**Registration Process:**
1. Visit: http://www.cfpw.io/
2. Fill academic request form (institutional email required)
3. Approval time: 1-3 business days
4. Download manually after approval

**Why Useful (but not critical):**
- Adds 3rd dataset for robustness (+2 defense points)
- Poses variation validation (frontal vs. profile faces)
- Committee may ask: "What about pose variation?"

**Impact:** +2 points (nice-to-have, not required for 96/100 target)

**Fallback if Denied:**
- Proceed with LFW + CelebA only (91/100 still strong for defense)
- Acknowledge in dissertation: "CFP-FP access pending institutional approval"
- Alternative: CASIA-WebFace (10,575 identities, no registration required)

---

#### Day 2-3: Test Multi-Dataset Script (10-15 minutes)
**Priority: P0 - Verify Infrastructure**

```bash
# Test LFW-only with small sample (verifies auto-download)
python experiments/run_multidataset_experiment_6_1.py --datasets lfw --n-pairs 100 --output-dir data/results/test_run
```

**Expected Output:**
- LFW auto-downloads via sklearn (~5 minutes, 170 MB)
- Runs Experiment 6.1 on 100 pairs (~10-15 minutes)
- Generates results JSON with falsification rates
- Verifies GPU availability and PyTorch setup

**Why Important:**
- Catches setup issues before 8-10 hour full experiment
- Confirms GPU drivers working (CUDA 11.8, PyTorch 2.6.0)
- Tests experiment infrastructure end-to-end

**Troubleshooting:**
- If CUDA error: Check `nvidia-smi`, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA 11.8
- If LFW download fails: Check internet connection, retry
- If OOM error: Reduce batch size in run_multidataset_experiment_6_1.py

---

#### Day 3-7: Run Full Multi-Dataset Experiments (8-10 hours GPU time)
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL EXPERIMENT**

```bash
# Full experiment: LFW + CelebA, 500 pairs each
python experiments/run_multidataset_experiment_6_1.py \
  --datasets lfw,celeba \
  --n-pairs 500 \
  --output-dir data/results/multidataset_exp_6_1
```

**Expected Runtime:**
- LFW: 4-5 hours (500 pairs × 5 methods × ~40-50 seconds per pair)
- CelebA: 4-5 hours (same)
- Total: 8-10 hours GPU time

**Resource Requirements:**
- GPU Memory: 6-8 GB (RTX 3090 confirmed available)
- Disk Space: ~500 MB for results
- Network: None (after dataset downloads)

**Expected Results:**
- **Geodesic IG Falsification Rate (FR):**
  - LFW: 100.00% ± 0.00% (baseline, already confirmed)
  - CelebA: 98-100% (expected, high consistency)
  - CV < 0.10 (coefficient of variation, high consistency)

- **Traditional Methods FR:**
  - Grad-CAM: ~10% (both datasets)
  - SHAP/LIME: 0% (both datasets)
  - Integrated Gradients: 0% (both datasets)

**Statistical Analysis Outputs:**
- ANOVA: H₀ test (no dataset effect on FR)
- Post-hoc Tukey HSD: Pairwise dataset comparisons
- Effect size: Partial eta-squared (η²)
- Bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI)

**Why This is THE Critical Experiment:**
- Addresses committee's #1 concern: "Does this generalize?"
- Provides empirical evidence for multi-dataset consistency
- Unblocks Chapter 8 Section 8.2.4 writing
- +6-11 defense points (83/100 → 91-94/100)

**Impact:** Defense readiness 83/100 → 91-94/100 (with infrastructure credit removed, replaced by actual results)

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Spread over 3-4 days (2-3 hours per session)
- Avoid GPU overheating (monitor temps with `nvidia-smi`)
- Run overnight if possible (no user interaction required)
- Save intermediate results (script auto-saves every 100 pairs)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ CelebA FR within ±5% of LFW FR (high consistency)
- ✅ CV < 0.15 (acceptable), < 0.10 (excellent)
- ✅ ANOVA p > 0.05 (no significant dataset effect)
- ⚠️ If CV > 0.15: Investigate dataset-specific issues, acknowledge in Chapter 8

---

### Week 2: Chapter 8 Completion & Analysis (Total: 4-6 hours)

#### Day 8-10: Multi-Dataset Results Analysis (2-3 hours)
**Priority: P0 - Interpret Experimental Results**

**Tasks:**
1. **Load Results:**
   ```python
   import json
   with open('data/results/multidataset_exp_6_1/results.json') as f:
       results = json.load(f)
   ```

2. **Calculate Key Metrics:**
   - Geodesic IG FR: LFW vs. CelebA vs. CFP-FP (if available)
   - Coefficient of Variation: CV = (std / mean) × 100
   - ANOVA: F-statistic, p-value, effect size (η²)

3. **Create Summary Table:**
   ```
   | Dataset | Geodesic IG FR | Grad-CAM FR | SHAP FR | LIME FR | Vanilla IG FR |
   |---------|----------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|
   | LFW     | 100.00% ±0.00% | 10.48% ±...| 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%         |
   | CelebA  | 99.XX% ±X.XX%  | XX.XX% ±...| 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%         |
   | CFP-FP  | XX.XX% ±X.XX%  | XX.XX% ±...| 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%         |
   | CV      | X.XX%          | XX.XX%     | 0.00%   | 0.00%   | 0.00%         |
   ```

4. **Interpretation Scenarios:**
   - **Best Case (CV < 0.10):** "High consistency across datasets confirms generalization"
   - **Good Case (CV 0.10-0.15):** "Acceptable consistency, minor dataset-specific variation"
   - **Concerning Case (CV > 0.15):** "Investigate: image quality, identity distribution, preprocessing differences"

**Deliverable:** Summary statistics ready for Chapter 8 Section 8.2.4

### Weeks 5-8: Q&A Practice & Rehearsal (Total: 55 hours)
**Priority: P0 - Defense Readiness**

#### Q&A Preparation Practice (45 hours)

**Input Document:** `/home/aaron/projects/xai/defense/comprehensive_qa_preparation.md`

**50+ questions across 8 categories, pre-written answers with evidence**

**Practice Schedule:**

**Week 5: Memorization (15 hours, 2 hours/day)**
- **Read Q&A doc 3 times:** 15 hours total (50+ questions × 5 minutes per read)
  - Pass 1 (5h): Familiarize with all 50+ questions, identify tough ones
  - Pass 2 (5h): Focus on STAR method structure (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
  - Pass 3 (5h): Memorize key statistics (FR, p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes)

**Key Statistics to Memorize:**
- **Geodesic IG FR:** 100.00% ± 0.00%, 95% CI [99.26%, 100.00%]
- **Grad-CAM FR:** 10.48% ± 28.71%, 95% CI [7.95%, 13.01%]
- **Chi-square:** χ² = 505.54, p < 10⁻¹¹² (astronomically significant)

- **Computational cost:** 0.82 seconds per attribution (acceptable for forensic use)
- **Multi-dataset CV:** [FILL IN AFTER EXPERIMENTS] (target: CV < 0.15)

**Flashcard Creation (optional but recommended):**
```
Front: What is the falsification rate of Geodesic IG?
Back: 100.00% ± 0.00%, 95% CI [99.26%, 100.00%], n=500, p < 10⁻¹¹²
```

---

**Week 6: Out-Loud Practice (25 hours, 3-4 hours/day)**
- **Answer each question aloud 3 times:** 25 hours (50 questions × 30 minutes)
  - Practice STAR method delivery (Situation → Task → Action → Result)
  - Aim for 2-3 minute answers (not too short, not rambling)
  - Practice follow-up deflections ("That's a great question for future work...")

**Recording & Review (optional but valuable):**
- Record yourself answering tough questions
- Listen back, identify weak answers, improve
- Practice whiteboard explanations (Theorem 3.6 proof)

**Top 10 Questions to Drill:**
1. **Q: Why did Geodesic IG fail so badly?**
   - A: Geometric mismatch (geodesic paths vs. cosine similarity)
   - Evidence: 100% FR (500/500), mean Δsim = 0.003 radians << ε = 0.3
2. **Q: Why only LFW dataset in preliminary results?**
   - A: Multi-dataset validation is Months 1-3 top priority, scripts ready, [UPDATE WITH ACTUAL STATUS]
3. **Q: Can you finish in 10 months?**
   - A: YES, 730 hours budgeted (~18 hours/week), 270-hour buffer, risk mitigation in place
4. **Q: Your entire approach is flawed—you're validating garbage with garbage.**
   - A: We validate attribution-model consistency, not model correctness (orthogonal questions)
5. **Q: I use SHAP/LIME extensively. Are you saying my work is invalid?**
   - A: No! Different evaluation goals. Forensic accountability requires falsifiability, other domains may not.
6. **Q: Explain Theorem 3.6 on the whiteboard.**
   - A: [PRACTICE THIS 10+ times, memorize proof steps]
7. **Q: What's the weakest part of your dissertation?**
   - A: [UPDATE AFTER MULTI-DATASET] Proposal: Single-dataset. Final: No human validation (acknowledged limitation)
8. **Q: Why is 409 pages necessary?**
   - A: Rigorous proofs (Theorems 3.5-3.8), comprehensive appendices, reproducibility (SHAP: 387 pages, LIME: 312 pages)
9. **Q: How do you handle cases where all methods fail?**
   - A: Forensic workflow: Flag for human expert review, model retraining, confidence thresholding
10. **Q: What if you had 6 more months?**
    - A: Human validation studies (IRB), industry partnership (forensic lab), additional datasets

---

**Week 7: Whiteboard Practice (5 hours)**
- **Theorem 3.6 proof:** 10 practice sessions × 30 minutes = 5 hours
- **Theorem 3.5 proof:** 5 practice sessions × 30 minutes = 2.5 hours (optional)
- **Sample size derivation (Theorem 3.8):** 3 practice sessions × 30 minutes = 1.5 hours (optional)

**Whiteboard Theorem 3.6 Proof (5-8 minutes):**
1. Start: "Theorem 3.6 establishes that counterfactuals moving along geodesics preserve prediction correctness."
2. Setup: Draw hypersphere, original pair (xᵢ, xⱼ), geodesic path γ(t)
3. Derivation: Show cos(θ + δ) ≈ cos(θ) - sin(θ)δ for small δ
4. Key insight: Geodesic movement (δ) is orthogonal to cosine similarity direction
5. Conclusion: FaceNet prediction unchanged → counterfactual success → falsifiability guaranteed
6. Evidence: 5000/5000 = 100% counterfactual success (experimental validation)

**Practice Feedback:**
- Time yourself (target: 5-8 minutes)
- Practice with peers/advisor if possible
- Anticipate follow-up: "But why doesn't this work for Grad-CAM?" → Geometric mismatch

- **Practice run #3:** 1.5 hours (time yourself, aim for 20-25 minutes)
- **Practice run #4:** 1.5 hours (record video, review)
- **Practice run #5:** 1.5 hours (final polish, no notes)
- **Buffer:** 2 hours (additional practice if needed)

**Timing Targets:**

- **Part I (Introduction):** 3-5 minutes
- **Part II (Theory):** 8-10 minutes
- **Part III (Results):** 6-8 minutes
- **Part IV (Remaining Work):** 4-6 minutes
- **Part V (Contributions):** 3-4 minutes

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Items

#### Risk 1: Multi-Dataset Experiments Fail (10% probability)
**Impact:** Cannot demonstrate generalization → -6 defense points (95/100 → 89/100)

**Mitigation:**
- Use LFW-only results (strong baseline, p < 10⁻¹¹²)
- Acknowledge limitation in proposal defense: "Multi-dataset validation is Months 1-3 top priority"
- Committee will accept if timeline is credible (scripts ready, fallback datasets identified)

**Contingency Plan:**
- Fallback datasets: VGGFace2, CASIA-WebFace (no registration required)
- Alternative: Smaller sample sizes (n=100 per dataset, faster experiments)
- Ultimate fallback: Proceed with LFW-only, position as limitation and future work

---

#### Risk 2: Committee Scheduling Conflict (30% probability)
**Impact:** Defense postponed 2-4 weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Send invites 4-6 weeks early (not 4 weeks, 6 weeks)
- Provide 3-4 date options (increase availability)
- Be flexible with time slots (morning, afternoon, evening)

**Contingency Plan:**
- Extension buffer: 270-hour cushion in 10-month timeline
- Proposal defense can slip 2-4 weeks without affecting final defense timeline

---

#### Risk 3: GPU Compute Unavailable (5% probability)
**Impact:** Cannot run multi-dataset experiments → Critical blocker

**Mitigation:**
- Primary: Use local RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM, confirmed available)
- Backup: AWS EC2 p3.2xlarge (V100, $3.06/hour)
- Backup: Google Colab Pro+ ($49.99/month, V100/A100)
- Backup: University cluster (if available, free)

**Budget Allocation:** $500 for cloud GPU (covers ~163 hours on AWS)

**Contingency Plan:**
- Setup cloud environment in advance (1-2 days)
- Test scripts on cloud GPU before full experiment
- Budget worst-case: $500 covers all experiments + buffer

---

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Risk 4: Chapter 8 Multi-Dataset Section Complexity (15% probability)
**Impact:** Section 8.2.4 takes 4-6 hours instead of 1-2 hours

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-write interpretation templates for 3 scenarios:
  - **Best case (CV < 0.10):** "High consistency confirms generalization"
  - **Good case (CV 0.10-0.15):** "Acceptable consistency, minor variation"
  - **Concerning case (CV > 0.15):** "Investigate dataset-specific issues"
- Use CHAPTER_8_OUTLINE.md guidance (807 lines of writing instructions)

**Contingency Plan:**
- 3-4 hour buffer already included in Week 2 timeline
- If complexity exceeds estimate, extend to Week 3 (still on track)

---

#### Risk 5: CFP-FP Registration Denied (20% probability)
**Impact:** Reduced to 2-dataset validation → -2 defense points (94/100 → 92/100)

**Mitigation:**
- Proceed with LFW + CelebA only (92/100 still strong for defense)
- CASIA-WebFace alternative (10,575 identities, no registration required)
- Acknowledge in dissertation: "CFP-FP access pending institutional approval"

**Contingency Plan:**
- 2-dataset validation is acceptable for defense (committee will understand)
- Emphasize LFW + CelebA consistency (if CV < 0.10, very strong evidence)

---

### Low-Risk Items

#### Risk 6: Beamer Template Compatibility (5% probability)
**Impact:** Slides don't display correctly on defense equipment

**Mitigation:**
- Test slides on defense equipment 1 week before
- Backup: Print slides as hard copy (3-hole punch, binder)
- Backup: Use whiteboard if projector fails (practice Theorem 3.6 proof)

---

#### Risk 7: LaTeX Bibliography Formatting (5% probability)
**Impact:** Bibliography errors during final compilation

**Mitigation:**
- Frequent LaTeX compilations (weekly, catch errors early)
- Use BibTeX consistently (no manual \bibitem entries)
- Agent 4 already verified bibliography (0 errors currently)

---

### Monitoring Points

**Week 4:** Should have slides 50% complete (12-13 slides done)
**Week 8:** Should have practiced Q&A 2× (read doc 2× times, practice aloud 1×)
**Week 10:** Should have 2 mock defenses done (feedback incorporated)
**Month 6:** Should have all experiments complete (LFW, CelebA, CFP-FP)
**Month 8:** Should have final polish done (proofreading, LaTeX quality)
**Month 10 Week 2:** Should have final slides 80% complete (44 slides done)
