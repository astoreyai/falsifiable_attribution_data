- Estimated completion: Pending agent execution
- Notes: Can proceed with verification, flag incomplete data

**Agent 4 Output Monitoring:**
```
Waiting for Agent 4 to complete...
Expected deliverables:
1. /home/aaron/projects/xai/TABLE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
2. /home/aaron/projects/xai/NOTATION_STANDARDIZATION.md
3. Updated LaTeX files with 4 algorithm pseudocode boxes
4. /home/aaron/projects/xai/FIGURE_QUALITY_REPORT.md
5. /home/aaron/projects/xai/PROOFREADING_REPORT.md
6. /home/aaron/projects/xai/LATEX_COMPILATION_REPORT.md
```

## Cross-Agent Dependencies

### Identified Dependencies:

1. **Agent 1 Chapter 8 outline → Agent 3 defense prep**
   - **Status:** RESOLVED
   - **Resolution:** Chapter 8 outline created for defense prep; full writing deferred until multi-dataset experiments complete
   - **Impact:** No blocker - defense prep can proceed with outline

2. **Agent 2 multi-dataset results → Agent 1 Chapter 8 writing**
   - **Status:** FUTURE WORK
   - **Resolution:** Chapter 8 full writing scheduled AFTER Agent 2 completes multi-dataset experiments
   - **Impact:** No immediate blocker - outline sufficient for now

3. **Agent 4 table fixes → Agent 1 Chapter 8**
   - **Status:** INFO FLOW
   - **Resolution:** Updated tables will inform Chapter 8 conclusions when written
   - **Impact:** No blocker - information flows naturally

### Critical Path Analysis:

**Longest dependency chain:** None currently blocking parallel execution

**All agents can proceed simultaneously** with the following notes:
- Agent 1: Creates Chapter 8 OUTLINE only (full writing later)
- Agent 2: Creates scripts even if datasets not yet downloaded
- Agent 3: Uses current dissertation state + Chapter 8 outline
- Agent 4: Flags incomplete data in tables, proceeds with verification

**No critical blockers identified for this session.**

## Orchestrator Notes

### Coordination Strategy:
1. Let all 4 agents execute in parallel
2. Monitor for blockers or dependency issues
3. Collect all outputs upon completion
4. Synthesize comprehensive status report
5. Calculate defense readiness score
6. Generate updated execution plan

### Expected Session Duration:
- Agent 1: 2-2.5 hours
- Agent 2: 4.75-5.25 hours (longest)
- Agent 3: 6.5-8 hours (longest)
- Agent 4: 10-14 hours (longest)

**Critical path:** Agent 4 (LaTeX Quality) - longest duration
**Expected total session time:** 10-14 hours of AI assistance

### Key Metrics to Track:
- Defense readiness score (starting: 85/100, target: 96/100)
- Total hours invested vs. 80-100 hour Scenario C plan
- Number of blockers encountered
- User action items required
